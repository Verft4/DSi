Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

With the support of the scientist Albert New, they travel through space and time, visiting these ancient people in person. Their objective is to collect relics from each civilization and create a museum of human memories. To achieve this, they will have to go through dangerous paths, facing obstacles, entrapments, and enemies. Your role is to memorize these obstacles and draw a safe path for them. Is your memory sharp enough to do that? Six different civilizations to visit, and three levels of difficulty. Checkpoints and flags can be used as markers to help you memorize the path. But you will earn a bonus if you don't use them.

Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R.

Over the course of decades, humanity has come to rely on humanoid weapons called Tactical Surface Fighters in their attempts to resist the alien onslaught. What choices will YOU make in a world that’s heading towards destruction? Your actions will change the course of history for the whole world... Project MIKHAIL is a mecha action game with three different modes of play: 1. A Story Mode with a full story for players to enjoy. 2. Frontier Mode, an online mode where all users inhabit a shared world, and each player’s actions have an influence on the story's outcome. 3. A PvP mode where players fight each other in their Tactical Surface Fighters. [Story Mode] In Story Mode, the player takes the role of Shirogane Takeru, the hero of Muv-Luv Alternative . Throughout the story, the player will be asked to make choices. How the story ultimately ends depends on the choices the player makes. In Story Mode, the player not only makes their own story, they also get to construct their own personal Tactical Surface Fighter mecha. By defeating the BETA and putting together the parts they drop, they’ll get to make their own ultimate fighting machine. [FRONTIER MODE] An online mode where all players inhabit a world where they're tasked with fighting the BETA invasion of Japan and saving the world. Every player’s actions will have an effect on the balance of power between various factions and individuals, each with their own designs and plans for the future of Earth. Everything they do will change the state of the war. Think YOU know what we have to do to save the world? Come up with your own plans, or work with other players to learn secrets you could never find on your own, revealing these factions’ deepest secrets and saving the world from destruction. [PvP Mode] A player vs player combat mode. Players join two teams of 4 TSF pilots and battle one another. The Early Access version of PvP is still in beta, but in the future we’ll be adding: ・More TSFs to fight in. ・Voice chat ・Balance changes and roles to make team play more fun.","['English', 'Japanese']","['English', 'Japanese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/header.jpg?t=1652940346,https://www.project-mikhail.com,https://project-mikhail.com/en/support/,support-mikhail-en@ancr.jp,True,False,False,0,,0,328,253,,0,563,,670,0,670,0,"aNCHOR Inc.,fuzz, Inc.",aNCHOR Inc.,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,RPG,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Anime,Mechs,Hack and Slash,Strategy,Sci-fi,Simulation,Dark,Robots,Action RPG,Action-Adventure,RPG,Action,Third Person,Adventure,Tactical,Swordplay,Spectacle fighter,Early Access,PvP,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_99d86dcae78e23378dc1a5da0a65abf3a472e09c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9d4c4aa8936728fba70562df891b3f173b1a6428.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_8019583ecbf9fa9ce1f0d6e43623e5c8cb507475.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9cc13a574d7a0286f74195c6610fa4b41e9a28c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_0a3840381970cb1d9487d8024a477d106fe5b31f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_7c4620218a3c3ce260bb5300578d30343a29c8f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_1a9482cae60ddc8ada6a7f343666a661b401bc8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_960b58bb69e087c8b558c668fc4c7a2cc3aa1d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_07439c6cc1ad6a558a1510dc74ab0673e989f2fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_003cc058eea0de30292c8fb6029d8fee137441d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_e653d2d90e5b13bee943cc2cd3f9aa8e981b4111.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256847596/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361467,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256858534/movie_max.mp4?t=1635832857,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256857340/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361475"

Apart from your main weapon you also have access to hamster grenades and melee scratches! Use them wisely as they may be the difference between victory or defeat! Is your gun too weak? We got you! Pick up a new, stronger weapon from any of the weapon pickups around the map! Can you go on a rampage with your chosen cat? There are bonuses to your score when you achieve multiple kills! Build up that kill-streak as you get them all one by one! There are health and ammo pickups strewn about the map too, make sure to grab those and buff your way to the top of the scoreboard!

457140,Oxygen Not Included,"Jul 30, 2019",2000000 - 5000000,7507,0,24.99,2,"In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included you’ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you’re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts. Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button.

396640,TowerClimb,"Sep 22, 2015",0 - 20000,0,0,14.99,1,"TowerClimb is a difficult and rewarding procedurally generated platformer with roguelike elements. TowerClimb is set in a fantasy world where enormous and mysterious towers of ancient unknown origin stand above humanity, extending to the heavens. Humans are driven by curiosity to climb them, usually dying in the process. Struggle forward as a weak human, driven by an iron will to reach the top. The game borrows elements from the roguelike genre. A different adventure awaits each man; you will never play the same exact level twice. Run, Climb, Jump, Swim, and Fly your way up the tower's atmospheric and lethal worlds, using items and resources you find along your way. Quick thinking and strategy will keep you alive as you navigate the tower using unique platforming mechanics. TowerClimb is challenging, and rewards reflexes, skill, knowledge and problem solving ability. Quite often, The tower throws your character into dangerous situations which require you to think very carefully about your actions. A unique, randomly generated level system ensures players must always come up with interesting ways to complete a level. Hundreds of men will die before you posses enough skill and knowledge to conquer the tower. A screenshot of every man's death is saved, along with how he died, to track each and every attempt. TowerClimb at its core is an adventure platformer, with procedural levels and elements based on the rogue-like genre. It features local multiplayer support with an option for split-screen/single-screen. (a maximum of 25 simultaneous players is the limit. However, the game only supports 4 controllers (Xinput limitation). The remaining players must use the keyboard. A program like Xpadder can remap additional directinput controllers to keyboard keys) The game features a TON of content. The Tower is tall and daunting to conquer, with plenty of areas and secrets throughout the game. Getting/seeing everything will take players a long time. There's bonus modes to unlock and play on top of the main game as well. Each time you play the game, everything changes. The levels are different, random events can occur, rare items can be found, etc. The game will always keep you on your feet and give you refreshing challenges and experiences. The platforming mechanics in the game are set up to feel very tight and responsive in combination with the climbing mechanics. You always need to be on your feet and aware of your surroundings, while continually planning how to climb higher. As you progress higher, different worlds introduce new mechanics that mean your play style must evolve. 5 years in the making, by Davioware and Quazi, a team of two brothers who have been developing and playing games since childhood.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/header.jpg?t=1452807494,http://www.davioware.com,http://www.davioware.com/forum/,davioware@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,288,28,,0,228,,53,0,53,0,Davioware and Quazi,Davioware and Quazi,"Single-player,Multi-player,Shared/Split Screen,Partial Controller Support,Remote Play Together","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG","Indie,Action Roguelike,Action,Adventure,Rogue-lite,Pixel Graphics,RPG,Platformer,Difficult,Procedural Generation,Great Soundtrack,2D,Rogue-like,Local Co-Op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_e31dc45661bba44a4fd063bc6ed4799411b265e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_3b1f72b79430b6935a6eebfd76bbcd681c443a3e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_336a61fdfb2111120c4048bc8df5416ea8dcf1b5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_85ebb18e02ec298a7c2a09a955e95dbe9a3d67e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_e7fea8248e4e93d034328bae62e45c125f31ed03.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_421e546bb493472bd837fc1c22d69b57e576f208.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_3c2415648682479e48182a8ed9296b1d1c1677c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_ae90957dd60a4ca02567a9a1e78683c2e4b45263.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_372fb5385d3f89623527898701cf2f52b842ce07.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_7ab682072d7e925760570a060e14ec340dee666d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_c099acfcb0acf6089635b6406678bd14d0a326f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_2ee449eb319952219dcbf40c1ece4a341ed9ed22.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256656588/movie_max.mp4?t=1447378175

695420,Hex: Origins,"Sep 23, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,1.99,0,"Hex: Origins is a casual puzzle game based on a complete hexagon themed colorful experience. Enjoy a refreshing, calming and original experience, which is extremely easy to pick up but hard to master as you progress in the game. Across the multitude of game modes and levels you will encounter, you must place pieces composed of anywhere from 2 to 10 and more hexagons, each using up to 6 different colors. Everything in the game is based on two simple rules: You can place a piece anywhere on the board with no restrictions as long as all the neighboring tiles are empty. If one hex has a colored neighbor on the board, at least one of those neighbors needs to match its color. Building upon these simple rules, we added special board pieces and power-ups in order to create a fun and colorful experience. As long as you keep placing pieces on the board, its requirements for placing pieces change - so be careful about the order, colors and type of shapes you can use. Always plan ahead! Gameplay Hex: Origins offers you 4 different game modes, 2 available from the start, and 2 unlocked with tokens you earn while playing the game: Classic: a linear experience bundled up in Episodes, structured into 6 Chapters, each containing 6 Levels that you can play in 3 difficulties. Each Episode introduces new mechanics into gameplay and with each passing chapter, the difficulty is slightly raised - but so are the rewards! Flow: a linear experience similar to Classic, with the added requirement of connecting various battery pieces to light bulbs in order to power them up! Carefully plan your colored ways across the board and take up the challenge! Don't forget to fill up the board, though. Exploration: Give up the static board and expand in any direction! Exploration maps feature a center starting point with all the colors onto which you will start expanding in any direction you want. Treasure Hunting: On rare occasions you will find treasure map fragments. Assemble them into a map and embark on a  thematic journey in order to find the hidden treasures of Hex: Origins. Always remember that X marks the spot! Features Over 800 levels of ever-increasing challenges with 3 difficulty options Dynamic level difficulty &amp; no unique solutions: the moves you make always alter the possible shapes that can be placed thus making it easier or harder for yourself. As you place these pieces the game will try to generate pieces that you can use. Plan ahead carefully. Finish a level in any way possible! Shuffle mechanic: discard existing pieces and draw new ones in exchange for a tiny fraction of your progress bar. 5 power-ups that you can use to slightly alter or completely change the game board. Special bonus shapes: from time to time a difficult to place piece will appear (9+ hex piece). Place it on the board and successfully finish the level and earn extra rewards. Complete in-game quests that range from easy to hard and get awesome rewards! Open treasure chests and reap the rewards while you complete any level! Unlock custom hex piece skins. Customize your board with that extra bling! Customize the game experience with 9 beautiful backgrounds!

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us,http://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/support/,support@koeitecmo.co.uk,True,False,False,0,,0,3075,6009,,44,5946,,215,15,76,15,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together",Action,"Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"

572330,The Fan,"May 10, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,5.99,0,"The Fan is an interactive photo fiction with real locations and actors. Follow the story of 'The Fan', a serial killer abducting women to fulfill his dark fantasies. His latest catch lies in his basement but she's not ready yet. Everything needs to be perfect for the ritual, when he'll show her 'True love'. The fan is a first person exploration game with a unique twist. Driven by a creepy and unsettling atmosphere, it will take you deep within the darkest places of Paris underground. Gameplay The Fan is entirely made with photos . It has a classic 'point and click' feel, using only left and right click but it's closer to the recent Telltale Game series than to traditional adventures games. There are no painful mini-games or artificially inserted sliding puzzles as it is more about discovery and choices. Find out more about the Killer and his victims as the story unfolds and you may be the one to ultimately decide their fate. WARNING : The game isn't rated yet but I wouldn't recommend if if you're under 16, due to the themes and some violent sequences. More About Me My name is Cyril and I'm a Frenchie indie game dev. The Fan is my first released game ever =) The game was created using Unity Personal Edition and mostly Lightroom for the pictures. I started the project in 2012 and did all the shootings, which was really fun, but when it came to actually 'make a game', well, it took much more time, effort, tutorials, training and hard work than I expected :D Although The Fan is a pretty short experience (there are no overly twisted puzzles to keep you from going fast if you wanna rush it), it took thousands of pictures and a tremendous amount of work to make it look good enough. So please, tell me what you think! Feel free to contact me directly if you have any question or comment, I'll be happy to answer!","['English', 'French']","['English', 'French']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/header.jpg?t=1593004829,http://thefan-game.blogspot.fr/p/about-thefan.html,http://thefan-game.blogspot.fr/p/about-thefan.html,cyril.danon@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,72,43,,0,0,,11,0,11,0,Ezhaac Studio,Plug In Digital,"Single-player,Steam Trading Cards",Adventure,"Violent,Adventure,FMV,Point & Click","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_fa468acb606b49f742ca71af638208be4d98e237.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_a3ebd7ad69ae9fa5977897da6b2d79e28c9c1e16.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_0f69a0d17d57d6bfb74b855c5f716970eead8ea3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_e6d0da1e520f6cc3795fcae23bcaf38d97c43469.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_a7272a2201aae4570ec7688ddc67f8fd140b9736.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_f0152026f2310ad74f3f4210d92a364c48b01bf6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_710ae5b32f086cc50cd639b42ea42f9495395d90.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_75707ab66d87213beb3819c4d03966d081ac9288.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_91c3a15f59717398882f260edf57f7a20638584b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_79156d65d61f05d49efb4320de2597f06675dc36.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256679070/movie_max.mp4?t=1494411412,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256679071/movie_max.mp4?t=1494411421"

To restore freedom he must first recover the broken pieces of the amulet, but his journey is filled with many challenges. Danger and evil forces await as you guide Lathan on his quest of power and magic.

Instead the player has full control over Thayer Alconred's movement to different areas and must find and use a variety of magical objects to overcome enemies and obstacles. There are many ways to mess up and permanently lose the game. There are several branching paths, resulting in different dialogue.

926140,CHANGE: A Homeless Survival Experience,"May 1, 2020",100000 - 200000,15,0,14.99,1,"CHANGE is an emotional homeless survival experience set in a randomly generated city with rogue-like elements. Explore, survive, earn perks, find items and kindness to develop your character and escape to a new life. With hundreds of perks, items, events and more, this serious game comes with a large amount of depth that opens up the more you play, and changes based on how you play. 20% of Delve Interactive's profits from this game will be donated to charities focused on the issue of homelessness. This is a hate letter to the growing indifference in the world. When members of the development team almost fell into homelessness some years ago, it inspired us to create something that gives a voice to the forgotten and the vulnerable. We take the subject very seriously and portray it as such. After over 7 years of research and hard work, 100s of updates and fan support, we bring you our tale of survival and isolation. Choose from 5 different characters each with their own background stories and maladies, then create your own story Find companions and find kindness. Build a reputation or even friendships with various characters including the other homeless and the police Build your inventory with food, survival tools, clothing and more... as well as unlocking new items for your next playthrough as you progress Spend a night in police stations, parks or shelters, spend time at bars, visit the clinic, study in the library, recycle scrap and more as you discover new areas and buildings Learn about the lives of the homeless and everything they go through to survive, with every part of the truth having been heavily researched by the developers Experience a beautifully composed emotional soundtrack Manage your hunger, hygiene, happiness, crime levels, street reputation, study levels and other stats as you try to survive and escape the homeless life. But you can only do so much in one day... what will you do? Will you spend the day begging, depending on the kindness of others? Will you find shelter in the night? Perhaps you're moved out of the area by the police for loitering. Unable to find shelter, you end up on the streets at night, and you meet a dog. Is it a stray? Could it be a friend? All your actions affect your happiness in some way, and it's up to you to manage your stats accordingly. You could turn to drink, but risk addiction. You could hope for a fortunate event, or make some progress towards your survival. But you will have to choose. It could all be over if a bad event occurs in the dangerous night streets. Especially during winter. Every game is different, and with each playthrough comes more ways to explore CHANGE. If you became homeless... what would you do? PLANS Our goal with this project is to raise awareness on the issue of homelessness, as well as raise money for it. We have done a ton of research for this project and while our wish is to portray the reality of homelessness, various aspects of sleeping rough have been abstracted for the sake of gameplay. So far, we've raised over £7000 for the charities CRISIS, The Clocktower Sanctuary and Shelter. Join us in the community section to discuss the game with the team! We're always listening and awaiting your feedback.","['English', 'German', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],"“With this rich, emotional overlay, coupled with some deep, appealing mechanics, CHANGE is an enthralling survival experience from start to finish.” New Game Network “Change is a gritty, hand-crafted, labor of love that transcends its simple, pixilated aesthetic.

739720,Penkura,"Dec 19, 2018",0 - 20000,1,0,9.99,0,"Penkura combines the wonderful worlds of real-time strategy and first-person exploration. Easy to pick up but hard to master, Penkura utilizes classic death mechanics that leave you without your equipment each time you perish. For this reason, you are able to construct your own robotic companions to help you build bases, gather resources, and protect your settlement. It encourages players to choose from a variety of approaches through which to complete their goals. Players will find themselves becoming an expert in areas entirely of their choosing. The intention is that, when the co-op is unveiled, players will find that the interaction of their unique skillsets with those of their peers creates capable and rewarding team gameplay. Penkura offers buildings, machines, bots, and items for you to construct. Most of it is made with the 'MMC' (Molecular Matter Converter) or through 'CCC' (Command Control Communication), which provides a top-down camera similar to that of classic RTS games. Should you desire, you can take control of your own intrepid bot to scout out a potentially hazardous environment or repair your base without stepping outside of the safety of your home. This is only the beginning of CCC potential; the rest is in your hands. Penkura’s crafting and base construction systems are made with co-op already in mind. Before its final release, you’ll be able to cooperate with other players to create huge, complex sets of items and stations that would normally take more than twice as long to put together. Deep beneath Antarctic ice, a Polish research team discovered an ancient temple that appeared to be a gateway to a fascinating new world.  The idea to migrate mankind to a new planet was a blessing for an overpopulated and devastated Earth. Project 'Gemini' was launched to colonize the new world. For 41 years, brave men and women traveled through the temple’s singularity.

In the wake of the Noble Faction’s occupation of Heimdallr, civil war has broken out across Erebonia. The provincial armies, loyal to the aristocracy and the Four Great Houses, have claimed many of the nation’s great cities in the name of the Noble Alliance. The Imperial Army, called back from the four corners of the Empire, has only just begun its sweeping counterattack. After Rean managed to escape Trista with Celine and Valimar, he awakens in the mountains near his hometown uncertain what fate befell his friends, who bravely threw themselves in harm’s way to buy him time to flee. Though the road will not be an easy one, Rean decides to take up his sword again, journeying across Erebonia with his Divine Knight, Valimar, in search of his friends from Class VII and a way to end the conflict before its price becomes far too dear… ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Taking place on the same continent as the fan favorite Trails in the Sky offshoot of Nihon Falcom’s storied The Legend of Heroes franchise, Trails of Cold Steel II (Sen no Kiseki II in Japanese) is a direct sequel to Trails of Cold Steel, picking up one month after the decisive collision that changed the fate of the entire nation of Erebonia. The speedy, tactical turn-based combat with the newly-developed “ARCUS” system returns with all the bells and whistles together with the new Overdrive mode, new means of transportation both across the land and sky, new allies, new dangers, and a renewed sense of hope as Rean tirelessly works to right the wrongs that have led the country to disarray. KEY FEATURES A Direct Sequel that Remembers the Past Clear data from Trails of Cold Steel carries over into Trails of Cold Steel II, granting players bonuses, and most importantly, remembering the many relationships cultivated during time spent at Thors Military Academy, allowing for more personalized conversations throughout the story. Take to the Land and Sky in New Modes of Transportation Fast travel isn’t just for Trista anymore; a personalized airship now allows players to swiftly choose and descend upon both familiar and foreign destinations alike—and on land, horseback riding not only returns, but players can now customize and utilize Angelica’s orbal bike for fast transportation across the map. The Link System Returns with a new Overdrive Mode Bonding with allies continues to pay off with the Combat Link System, netting a variety of combat benefits including healing, guarding, and more, and the new Overdrive mode allows linked characters to attack up to three turns in a row for new strategic battle options. Experience the Game as Never Before 50% more lines of English voice-overs have been added to the PC release, bringing a fresh experience to even those who have played it before on console. New features for this release include ultrawide aspect ratio support, turbo mode, and an instant resume feature that allows players to launch directly from Steam to their most recent save.","['English', 'Japanese']","['English', 'Japanese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/header.jpg?t=1624575761,http://www.trailsofcoldsteel.com/cs2/,,support@xseedgames.com,True,False,False,81,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-ii?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,2113,125,,51,1992,,4495,0,8126,0,Nihon Falcom,"XSEED Games,Marvelous USA, Inc.","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards",RPG,"JRPG,RPG,Anime,Story Rich,Great Soundtrack,Turn-Based,Singleplayer,Mechs,Fantasy,Romance,Turn-Based Combat,Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_6dea04af73ae5d627709d8c5f4e2915d853ab915.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_19987af42f6d8291e4ca576a164d8889d95d4295.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_9e5559f21b1cc1171a9380fe51f1179922d35ad2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_aee59e52d82c780e2fb858afbded2968f2d46057.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_ae9eb7689f95e1040f02247f1ca53e037809a1af.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_17cbcda4f4ab6d5e63682d612aa02b50e014f7a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_35971c69aed991097bba64fb5db2f494851d3717.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_f192cc7fc5f9d9bb44f7f98dc57024c3e3869d10.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708880/movie_max.mp4?t=1551805118,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256706454/movie_max.mp4?t=1551805134"
544220,Damage: Sadistic Butchering of Humanity,"Dec 11, 2016",0 - 20000,0,0,4.2,0,"THE GAME Damage is a violent but humorous 2D-adventure-shooter based on Amiga cult classic which was originally released in 1996. The idea of Damage is simple: kill as many people as possible! Damage is an adventure game where you can roam freely in a wide urban setting, loot money and goods, buy weapons and other equipment from the black market and kill thousands of enemies: harmless civilians, policemen, army troopers, organised criminals, bloodhounds and vehicles. DSBoH is humoristic and harmless outlet for our violent instincts. THE STORY In Damage you take control of a formerly exemplary man named Michael Modelcitizen, who had everything a man could possibly dream of. Because of that, he soon became deeply frustrated. Michael tried various methods in search of a new super human state, but during the process something went terribly wrong. The solution to regaining his previous status is ugly. Michael starts with a primitive baseball bat, taking out unaware passers-by. It's not long before Michael's actions begins to attract the members of authority - who all try to eliminate him. Of course, he has access to numerous appetising weapons, and he starts experimenting with dangerous drugs to keep himself alive. In Damage, you play as Michael and we guarantee you many, many delightful discoveries and a feeling of extreme freedom to venture and express yourself. LEGACY About Amiga version (1993-1997) The enormous project of making an ideal game of our own started back in 1993. We soon became overly ambitious, and we had no idea of what it took to carry out our plans. But we couldn't give in, just took new challenges to make Damage the best it could be. In 1996 the game was ready and players loved it!",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/header.jpg?t=1481453954,http://sadisticbutchering.com,http://sadisticbutchering.com,info@suomi-peli.fi,True,False,False,0,,0,5,13,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Suomi-Peli,Suomi-Peli,Single-player,"Sexual Content,Nudity,Violent,Gore,Action,Adventure,Indie,Early Access","Gore,Nudity,Indie,Sexual Content,Action,Early Access,Violent,Adventure,Dark Humor","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_9db08480c2f425197319f0ca137d7911e5bc63e1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_9608f2a910b64755f6d759f51158238a3c4d5b2d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_e271dfa796de9756e345ab9f1b4fc200b1ce99a2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_145338cda9be97611bd17d03350ab56b20e694d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_aaf604428ee8743fae6ad84d3ce202accd280efb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256675884/movie_max.mp4?t=1481133083

523680,Honey Rose: Underdog Fighter Extraordinaire,"Sep 29, 2016",20000 - 50000,0,0,0.0,8,"IMPORTANT NOTE: For all information regarding DLC and the 'Pay-what-you-like' remuneration model, please read the information below! What the game is about: Honey Rose: UFE tells the story of Red, a young university student with dreams of making it big at the masked fighting tournament . She looks up to Big Blue , the current champion, and aims to meet her idol in the ring ! However, she has a history of poor class attendance , and has repeatedly failed her latest classes. This year, she made a deal with her parents : she’d either graduate, or they’d change towns. Unfortunately, the masked fighting tournament also takes place for the first time in the very town Red lives in... making it her one and only chance to make her dream come true! Thankfully, that’s where you come in ! With your guidance, she needs to balance her studies with her training so she can bring home both the champion's belt, and her graduation. The game is a life-management simulation , presented as a visual novel , with beat'em-up elements . In short: some reading, a little fighting... and lots of planning! Features: A visual novel based around choice and reactivity! See how events unfold based on your decisions... or lack of commitment! A sizeable cast of characters to encounter in dynamic events, with individual subplots to pursue! Fight for your dreams in the ring, or to get back your suit from dastardly thugs in the street! Plan ahead to make the most of the 6 months you have left until graduation! Bring home the champion's belt if you can, but make sure to ace your tests as well! Can you really do both? Pricing The game uses a 'pay-what-you-liked' remuneration model. 'Pay-what-you-liked' is a system designed after 'pay-what-you-want', except you choose to support the game *after* having played it for yourself , and determined its personal value based on your own experience. It is designed to offer each player the most choice possible in how, when and why when considering whether to support the game or not . Since Steam doesn't support 'pay-what-you-liked' or 'pay-what-you-want' remuneration systems, the DLC acts as a stand-in to offer multiple suggested tiers of support . IMPORTANT NOTE : buying DLC stands in for supporting the game at the value of the suggested tier. It will NOT enhance or change your ingame experience, you will not be getting additional content other players can't access , as the aim for this system is for the game to be the same for everyone: ie, its most complete state right off the bat! That also means the game is NOT F2P/P2W: there is NO in-game economy that allows you to pay for additional content. The game is fully available for free from the minute you start playing it!",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/header.jpg?t=1478020022,http://pehesse.fr/honey/,,honeyUFE@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,32,9,,37,0,,0,0,0,0,Pehesse,Self,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,Indie,Strategy","Action,Adventure,Indie,Strategy,Visual Novel,Female Protagonist,Beat 'em up,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_09e82a595abc068ad4a27e8fad05576f46411d33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_787917ee9afb79fd2bf5d442d46a0b43c43d8bfc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_0a67f4a7c2031187b0460de021e0d569f6875983.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_a6a1bd8104824fad0b9b398ee7fd70242672bd72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_702b0c1e792a0b4f3c7dd43a1bad9193a41a725b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_6b04fc096767209ed2a15412b29b0fef97e0117f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_687a63ca117854407dfc96811f4171dd3e87bad0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_f4b67258f40fb937e28389c2db1a3032a65ffaa8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_bdb4e00f3971ba91b1bde9ba5f56d3db79654e79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_9064fd49444f8e84e60e1aaf04bd9021b3faa733.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_e87d876362f4f00f5d6e7d117040144e89d3081c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_94dc8365b330b6edb957e7ebbcb4d59145349848.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_a143f73252403c449a1dcee8566351ea3c2621cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_d4421cf7267c3a916f693241d2f80e193427cf9f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256670193/movie_max.mp4?t=1473458904,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256670194/movie_max.mp4?t=1473458916"

Construct additional power plants to boost your power economy and extend your reach with substations. Is the situation looking exceedingly grim?

Serious strategy in a light-hearted setting Plan your moves carefully: as with any turn-based strategy game, make tactical decisions and work with the outcome Your leader knows best: Commander Grak knows it all and is not shy to share his thoughts. Hear him out, or dismiss him straight away and focus on the action Challenge all: demonstrate your skills in the campaign mode, multiplayer (online/hotseat/local) and skirmish battles Tinker with the AI: an API is provided that allows you to program the most fearsome opponents possible Achieve the impossible: we dare you to do the (almost) unachievable and collect a range of precious achievements In the story driven campaign, you will take on rival factions as a recruit in the Blue Blobbie army.

3010,Xpand Rally,"Aug 24, 2006",20000 - 50000,2,0,4.99,0,"Xpand Rally is a breathtaking game that gives you the true to life experience of driving powerful rally cars amidst photorealistic sceneries. Realistic weather effects, rolling hills, and animated scenery all add to game's visual perfection. Xpand Rally also features highly detailed models of modern rally cars and handling physics developed with the help of rally sport professionals which further enhance the realism of driving experience. Xpand Rally combines the best elements of Rally and Rally Cross racing in one unique gaming experience. The game offers a career mode based on time trials during both individual races and World Championship Series which will satisfy traditional Rally fans. The Rally Cross fans won't be disappointed either - they can challenge several opponents in head to head racing during competitions based on real and fictitious race events. Xpand Rally, as the only title on the market, brings the economy factor into a rally game. The player starts with a junk car and competes in races to earn money and acquire upgrades, repair damage, tweak performance and pay the race entry fees. Along with the tuning-up, the car's condition affects its handling. Due to accurate damage system, it is highly dependent on the player's driving skills. The physical handling model is also influenced by car parts configuration and provides both authentic feel and joy of driving. The interactive race track surroundings with enhanced game physics and the innovative approach to changing daytime and weather conditions, both influencing the car handling, are other hallmarks of Xpand Rally that distinguish it from other racing games. For the first time among rally games Xpand Rally includes a complete set of easy-to-use editing tools enabling to create new tracks, cars or even game mods.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/header.jpg?t=1639506578,http://www.xpandrally.com,,,True,False,False,82,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/xpand-rally?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,293,73,,0,311,,138,0,138,0,Techland,Techland,"Single-player,Multi-player",Racing,"Racing,Driving,Automobile Sim,Physics,3D,Economy,Multiplayer,Singleplayer,Offroad","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000484.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000483.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000485.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000481.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000482.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000001253.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000001254.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000001255.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578",

304970,SolidFace Parametric CAD Modeler 2D/3D,"Dec 22, 2014",0 - 20000,0,0,0.0,0,"Part module SolidFace Sketch automatically creates parametric reference for modeling features that can be edited in a very simple and interactive way. This is an in-house developed module and fully integrated with the 3D module. SolidFace allows multiple bodies creation. A powerful tool helps in the development of dependent parts from a single part file. The parameterization allows not only an easy model editing, but also parts family creation that is an important issue in automating creation of variant models with the same constructive basis, such as fasteners, automotive, hydraulic and civil components. From a parametric part you can automatically generate dozens of others parts through parameters association, such as thickness, length, number and diameter of holes, color, material, information, text, etc. Assembly module Easy, accurate and effective, this module enables you to build assemblies using modeled parts and sub-assemblies. The automatic link between the modules facilitates the manipulation of assembly parts, thus any editing on a part or assembly, results in an automatic change in the assembly that references this component. You can build assemblies by inserting components created outside the assembly document; this is known as bottom-up assembling or if you need to construct a component that needs dimension references of some assembly components, you can create it, within the Assembly module. This operation is called in-context or top-down part creation. To facilitate the assembly process, the part elements can be enabled or disabled at any time without interfering the process of inserting (bottom-up) or creating (top-down) new components. Drawing module Besides the 2D draft capabilities explained in the SolidFace drawing product, you can also insert parts and assemblies into the drawing module in order to generate automatic orthographic, sections and details views. These views and dimensional annotations are created according to DIN and ANSI norms. Personalized by the designer. The 3D models views can be displayed in several model styles. The sections or details views are automatically created and aligned with the base view. Another advantage of the automatic link between the modules is the ability to copy and paste 2D geometric entities to the 3D Sketch module in order to use it as reference geometry to 3D features operations like extrude, revolve, etc. Exploded view An exploded view is a diagram, picture or technical drawing of an object, that shows the relationship or order of assembly of various parts. This allows the components (parts and sub-assemblies) to be visualized with defined displacements. The exploded view can be enabled or disabled at any time of the project creation. 3D Direct modeling Interact directly with the geometry of the model. Manipulate it by pushing, pulling, or twisting. Keeping the steps that create the final model, direct modelling allows the features geometry to be parametric modified by editing the feature used to create the new faces. 2D/3D Movement simulation One of the many capabilities of logical conditions is to enable the system to detect the collision of components assembly. The collision or the simulation process can be aborted and analyzed at any time. This makes possible not just a simple mechanism video demonstration but also a real-time movement simulation. The parameterization capability is one of the greatest advantages of SolidFace and it is present in all design steps. 3D Motion simulation is no different; the simulation is updated simultaneously with the movement. Another important capability is the simulation of 2D mechanisms, which can be performed either in 2D drawing or in 3D sketch module.

And trust me, it will be a journey to remember! It all started a few months ago… Sally and I were happy in her salon. Being beauticians, making girls pretty… business was booming! That all changed when her “best friend” (hah!) April came around, offering Sally a “chance of a lifetime”. Sally, bless her, chooses only to see the good in people, and actually listened to April. Next thing you know, she’s sold her salon and used all her savings to become co-owner of Happyville, a luxurious spa. And that’s when the real chaos started… April is fixated on earning a Mirage star for the spa and is willing to do anything - and everything - to get one!

But most importantly, it’s about understanding your cat. In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system. This game fits best for... - People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work - Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids - Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding - Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about ‘wasting their time’ (although we believe you shouldn’t feel guilty at all while playing games!) - Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun - Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it - People who like smart cats Learn how machine learning works in real life! The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don’t worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required! Train yourself into a data science wizard! Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen. Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist! Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you’ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That’s what real data scientists do! Coding just got real! Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it’s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right? Improve your gear, improve your life! Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you’ll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it’s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe! Fun fact: this is what machine learning specialists actually do.

392030,Murasaki,"May 12, 2016",0 - 20000,0,0,4.99,1,"A mystical world on the edge of destruction. Unlikely saviors joined by fate and duty. A mission driven by music, magic...and survival. Murasaki is a hybrid shmup and puzzle game that creates intense and high-speed gameplay against a serene landscape with gorgeous music. With the ability to only fire a single bullet at a time, you must use cunning, angles and timing to survive. Random shapes will appear as the levels progress: these designs will trigger massive explosions when shot. If you can bounce corresponding shapes off of each other, they'll create a chain reaction that, with a little luck, will wipe the screen. Don't wait too long, because the enemies will overwhelm you in a second! If you can't get a clear shot, each character has a special attack with limited uses. Use them wisely to get out of a tight situation or to put the finishing blow on one of several bosses! Characters Kairi The older of the heroes, Kairi acts as a big brother, though he's not related to Satsuki. His movements are slow, but his long range shot can reach anywhere on the screen, perfect for ricochet combinations. This however, also means that you don't have rapid shots. Kairi's special attack is a spiraling explosion that reaches most of the screen. This bomb can absorb enemy's bullets and destroy multiple targets. Use it wisely. Satsuki The younger hero, Satsuki is impetuous and headstrong, and it shows in her attack formation. Satsuki can move across the screen quickly, but the range of her shots is very short. Sometimes they won't reach the enemy. However, using her speedy shots, you can bounce the explosive blocks farther than Kairi, which makes it easier to create a chain attack with other blocks. Just be careful not to bounce them too far, or the explosion won't reach the enemy! Her special attack is a cross-formation energy wave. It hits harder than Kairi's, but could easily miss if the timing is off. Use it wisely. Find your center and get into a flowing rhythm of evading and exploding. If you can master the mechanics, Murasaki is insanely satisfying, mixing the mayhem and the tranquil music in a beautiful dissonant clash. Failure means death, swift and painful. Don't look at where the bullets in front of you go: plan for where the explosions will happen afterwards. There is a long and tragic story within Murasaki: each successful (and even unsuccessful) chapter unlocks new information, history, bios and even musical tracks. To truly understand the full game, you must become an expert with both Kairi AND Satsuki. It's daunting, it's hard, but the satisfaction of a full unlock is unmatched. Config You can start a config tool from 'Launch Configuration Tool' when you start the game. Here, you can configure the screen size, BGM/SE ratio, key bindings, etc. The death of an empire. The rise of darkness. And two heroes alone combat a broken soul.","['English', 'Japanese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/header.jpg?t=1578972607,http://katatema.main.jp/mu/,,support@playism.jp,True,False,False,0,,0,85,8,,48,0,,0,0,0,0,Katatema,PLAYISM,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud","Action,Indie","Action,Indie,Bullet Hell,Shoot 'Em Up,Anime,Great Soundtrack,Puzzle,Singleplayer,Arcade,2D,Casual,Female Protagonist,Difficult,Fantasy,Controller,Retro,Atmospheric,Colorful,Experimental,Cute","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_4115d58f8cc9da6c994cab98521befed122d0118.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_285723e0ac3ed606a80f42215f7dc2729de3058e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_403dbdfb1fd4dc8c04b4ef9bd04ff3b20eecfc68.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_c92a966fb2f34bebefafcf328657ae4aa0ce265e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_37412d3ee0e9b2bd10b0113f6be42778f40199c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_c7e0d85a7b1624ff9bead15a154ba9d45db55ec6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_42b64c0fd9cacdbc4aa84ce821cd7a0c5e5105f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_d007163a143881a64465a68f319e44ed509f635e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_fbec3bd2fcceadefa58f491ddecc3e2a97fa5f77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256662903/movie_max.mp4?t=1461316502,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256660464/movie_max.mp4?t=1461316516"

Generally it manifested itself as recovery of motion functions and need for food. But in some cases scientsits found out that the creatures had totally independent behavior and strong desire to control and destroy all species around for their personal purposes. As soon as the military got informed of such qualities of zombie-genome, they immediately started to develop a new kind of biological weapon. After many experiments they finally made the first prototype of a biological weapon which had its own mind and shapeless jelly-like body. It had an ability to take control of any living creature. This weapon gave them an opportunityto resolve any conflict by force. But one day there was an emergency. One of the labs in Colony No4 went out of power just for a few seconds. It was enough for the young bioweapon to feel free and escape. In this game you will act like the young bioweapon. You will encounter lots of traps and puzzles. You will have to possess human bodies to pass the game to the end. Good luck! In this game you’ll find: - good old platforms - lots of action and tactics - simple, exciting and original gameplay - 54 levels full of deadly traps - unique main character - 5 characters for walking through a game - perfect pixel art style.","['English', 'Russian']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/header.jpg?t=1458860484,http://immortalgamestudio.com/,http://immortalgamestudio.com/support,support@immortalgamestudio.com,True,True,True,0,,0,237,65,,16,266,,52,0,70,0,Immortal Game Studio,Immortal Game Studio,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards","Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie","Indie,Action,Casual,Adventure,Platformer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/ss_140a2fd6fb52ad0cc732ff1393ccd72fe06a4397.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458860484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/ss_1fd7825a112733c871b5cf95060528217dd28551.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458860484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/ss_01107b6fd7174ff7a0deda479ef1c109e2a061fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458860484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/ss_95321c0b96b9993702fe7399303b3f64d622a356.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458860484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/ss_53881d8e15fb21e3e7511b8016cc0ae9725652a1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458860484",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256660441/movie_max.mp4?t=1458371232

No graphics, no menus, no point-and-click — you navigate a written story using typed commands, and read what happens next. Travel to the haunted coastal town of Anchorhead, Massachusetts and uncover the roots of a horrific conspiracy inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft. Search through musty archives and tomes of esoteric lore; dodge hostile townsfolk; combat a generation-spanning evil that threatens your family and the entire world. A sprawling, meticulously detailed setting, brought to life by finely crafted prose and illustrated with dozens of spine-chilling illustrations, ensures that the story will stay with you long after you finish playing the game. A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder — fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones.

1588760,Switchball HD - Puzzle Platformer,"May 17, 2021",0 - 20000,0,0,2.69,0,"Switchball is an inventive and fun puzzle-driven game based on real world physical interactions. Beautiful and elegant 3D graphics offer panoramic views of 30 incredible levels in 5 amazing worlds. The game puts the player in the role of a marble, which is guided through a narrow winding course suspended in mid-air in five different worlds: Skyworld, Iceworld, Caveworld, Cloudworld and Lavaworld. The marble can be morphed into different balls with unique physical properties, like a Marble Ball, a Power Ball (which can be charged and have an accelerated 'dash', a 'jump' ability or switchable 'magnetism' properties), a Steel Ball (which can push heavy objects around), and so forth. Each course contains obstacles and traps, such as wooden blocks, sheets of cloth, spinning fans, magnets, and cannons. The game uses physics-based puzzles as well, such as moving boxes; also, different balls react to the environment in different ways; Steel Balls, for example, will tear cloth platforms. Each level is timed, and players are rewarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze medals, depending on how quickly they complete the level. Switchball has received several awards over the years and is now relaunched on Steam as Switchball HD. Originally called Crazy Ball, the game won 'Best PC Game' during the 2005 Swedish Game Awards and was a finalist in the 'Technical Excellence Class' during the 2006 Independent Games Festival. Switchball also won Team Xbox XBLA Game of the Year in 2007.

924740,Beyond Senses,"Jan 6, 2020",0 - 20000,0,0,7.99,0,"Thousands of writings and books tell of encounters with witches, ghosts, demons and the devil himself. Our world is complex and unexplored. We mostly don't notice anything of all this thanks to secret organizations whose objective is the elimination of paranormal phenomena . In Beyond Senses, you'll slip into the role of either a good hunter or an evil demon. Discover the world Beyond our Senses! Countless features guarantee a varied and unforgettable gaming experience . Beyond Senses can be played by up to 5 players! Beyond Senses is one of those rare multiplayer horror games that offer more than just one game mode! Three game modes are currently available: HUNT , EGOIST and BANISHMENT . Each game mode can be customized to your personal needs. In HUNT , your task is to weaken the wandering creature by charging blessed Energy Crystals and killing it afterwards. The more energy the Crystals receive, the weaker the creature becomes after some time. If the creature is weakened enough, you can kill it with your weapons and send it back to hell! In EGOIST you compete against your fellow players. Your goal is to conquer as many Energy Crystals as possible. Whoever has conquered the fewest Energy Crystals after a certain time will be hunted mercilessly by the wandering creature. You can use a stun gun to put your fellow players out of action for a short time and gain a time advantage. In BANISHMENT you must find all the cursed items and place them properly in a pentagram . Once you have successfully completed the ritual, you must lure the wandering creature into the pentagram to send it back to hell! Evil is all around us. Each location is individually designed and can be played in any game mode . All players should have the opportunity to create the best possible gaming experience for themselves. For this reason, new locations are constantly being added . There are currently 3 different maps available: CEMETERY FOREST HORROR HOUSE If you play as a hunter, you can currently choose between 4 different characters: John Hughes , Lauren Williams , Elijah Knight and Amy King ! As a creature, you currently have the choice between Dr. Walker (ghost) and Valac (demon). Both hunters and monsters have different 'skins', which can change the appearance of the characters. These skins will be unlocked during the course of the game by gaining experience points . From time to time there will be bonus actions or contests in which special skins can be unlocked. More hunters, monsters and skins will be added during the development of the game! So that your gaming experience does not go unrewarded, there is a level system. You start with level 1 and can work your way up to level 30. As you reach new levels, you'll unlock more skins , skills , lamps , weapons , tools and titles . Your experience points are assigned to your account and are not tied to your characters. The higher your current level is, the harder it will be to reach the next level. There is also a suitable subsystem : All tools and skills themselves can reach a higher level and become better through frequent use. Your account data is comfortably and securely stored in the Steam Cloud, so you can access it from other computers at any time! Beyond Senses offers a lot of features that we can't list completely with individual headings here. Therefore, all features of Beyond Senses that haven't been mentioned before are listed in this section: You can carry 2 of currently 4 gadgets with you: Holy Water, Sound Emitter, Incense Bomb, Devil's Trap Currently you can select 1 out of 6 possible light sources: Glowstick, Phone, Hand Lamp, Flashlight, Portable Searchlight, Night Vision At the moment you have 3 different handguns at your disposal: Remorse, Peacemaker, Vanquisher As a Hunter you can use one skill per round: Invisibility, Energy Incantation, Resurrection, Banishment, Teleportation Each Monster has 2 - 3 different skills, which can be used several times per round Currently you can unlock 5 titles: Ghost Hunter, Monster Banisher, Scaredy-Cat, Doll Hater, Living Legend .

Update v1.5- Token Stats System Token Stats is a visual stats system available on each token while in play mode. Stats can be hidden and shown as needed, on each token. This gives players access to quickly tracking HP and other important stats, to make playing easier. This works great with the token system and works with real miniatures by sitting tokens beneath them on the map. Token Name Current Hit Points Maximum Hit Points Actions Status Effects Facing Direction Token Ownership Update v1.7 - Dicey Dice (Filled Request) A simple Dice Roller allowing multiple dice to be rolled at the same time with each individual result being displayed. The dice display area can be cleared and closed to free-up screen space as needed. The dice roll from the view of the selected token, making dice results easy to read. Update v1.8 - Initiative System We've added an Initiative System to help track turns.. because even when playing with 3D printed miniatures, paper character sheets and real dice.. no one likes to track initiative! So let us track initiative for you! Give your tokens a unique name Click the 'add to Initiative' button Play! The tokens can mark their turn as done, delay until the end of the turn, be added and removed at any time. Clicking an image in the initiative bar pings the token on the map! (Tokens are also auto pinged at the start of their turns). And, you can also clear initiative and start fresh when ever you need.

The apocalypse was thousands of years in the past and many of those living today have very little to no knowledge of the events that transpired or the fact that there even was an apocalypse. Design Goals Our goal is to create a MMO experience that rings true to how classic tabletop Dungeons and Dragons feels with weekly meetups where the dungeon master is creating new custom content for his players taking their decisions and desires into account. We want to have a very active community and will be working very hard to interact directly with the players of the game. We also want to implement new concepts like temporary bosses that drop limited edition items. Controls Left Click to perform the most obvious action on a given tile. Right click to bring out a drop-down menu of all possible actions for a given tile. Tab to show or hide the sidebar. FAQ Here is a little set of common questions about the game in a FAQ format. We thought this would be an easy way to get across a lot of information. How do you guys make money? We sell bonds which grant membership. The bonds are redeemable for 14 days of membership and can be traded with other players if you so desire. This means its feasible to do an in game activity for someone who has already bought a bond and trade them for the bond as payment for the activity as a means to become a member. What is membership? Membership is the full game experience and unlocks access to all of the in game skills and grants access to the entire game world. Money made from membership helps us cover the server costs and really helps us out! Will you ever sell experience or items directly? No we will not. The only thing we will sell are bonds. The value of a bond in game is determined by the players and what they are willing to trade for them. The only way to gain experience or items will be to play the game. We don't believe in selling power. What are your goals in terms of membership? Our biggest goal would be to get 500 monthly members which would allow us to cover all our server costs and both work on the game full time. Any members over this amount would be an absolute blessing! What happens when I die in game? All of your currently equipped and all items in your inventory will be dropped and you will re-spawn in Split City. Will you reimburse my items if I die and lose a lot of them? No we will not, dying in game and losing items is part of the game and it's up to you to bank important items you don't wish to lose. How many towns are there in game? There are 14 towns currently in the game. What happens if I forget my password? As long as you provided your email address when creating your account we can reset your password for you. At a later stage we will facilitate linking your Steam account to your Damascus account which will provide extra security and password retrieval mechanisms. Why aren't you guys doing Early Access? The way we view MMORPG's is that they are inherently a service. Our goal is to constantly update the game as long as it is live. Due to this we didn't want to be yet another permanently in early access game and have decided to have the first stable version of the game be our release version with many updates and future content already in the pipeline. How often will you update the game? We plan to update the game every couple of weeks with new content, however this is a loose timeline and it could be shorter or longer depending on the content we are currently working on. We intend to be very active on Discord so you can always ask us directly about what we are working on and approximately when you can expect the next update. Will you ever expand the world map? Yes we do plan to at some stage release new Islands and Continents which will expand the scope and scale of the game. However these updates will take some time to implement and most likely come with new quests as some of our larger updates to the game. Will I get banned for selling in game items for cash to my friends? No you won't. All in game items earned by you belong to you and you a responsible for them, this means you are free to give them away or sell them to other people and it also means that it's your responsibility to not lose your items in silly ways (like attacking a Damascus Steel Dragon at a low level). Will I get banned for using/creating a third party client? We won't be supporting third party clients and we would consider this a bannable offense. The only version of the client one should use is the Steam version. Will I get banned for macroing or botting? Macros that make the game easier as well as botting are not in the spirit of the game and are considered a bannable offense. We suggest avoiding macroing entirely.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/header.jpg?t=1589537110,https://discord.gg/CVDFAv4,https://discord.gg/CVDFAv4,teamtealdom@gmail.com,True,True,True,0,,0,189,54,,25,0,,0,0,0,0,Team Teal,Team Teal,"Multi-player,MMO,Steam Achievements,In-App Purchases","Free to Play,Indie,Massively Multiplayer,RPG","Massively Multiplayer,Free to Play,RPG,Indie,Pixel Graphics,2D,Economy,MMORPG","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_09ae0a664bd80b26283a7fabf2b0572069068e58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_044c318d309fb5e2bdaf32842f9ee773a36d6627.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_9c4f009fbd63ea54bdccc2ca342e7344c61fd243.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_d333e7c8266d694426319988a7fadbe9df20b1f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_f4325752b5e755b354f73f6e00cda6f2945ff75c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_b7ea377efb198b58379ba7a4c16f58c7ece6c3ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_6553664497359546092e15afd602e4413ec31e08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_f0eb87b1532976f4c014ab6f9d07ba96ec2f4544.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_2eaa11488ab7f6b93fd69bd82c9b3fc73fd347e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_add4765877132c3a24256663c336106057eca96b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_bf3ed00c288f58eb46c693962e511a9a13a108b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_7b472d940d552898377e868a017c082d6570786c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256782449/movie_max.mp4?t=1587378324

358000,The Curse of Nordic Cove,"Apr 23, 2015",0 - 20000,0,0,0.99,0,"From Indie Developer, On The Level Game Studios: We at On The Level Game Studios are honored and thankful to Valve and our friends for all of your efforts in getting our first game, The Curse of Nordic Cove, through the Greenlight process. Originally released in a non-Steam version around April of 2013. Please note that our second game, Boo Bunny Plague, already received the Greenlight in mid-2014 and has been on Steam. We are currently hard at work on our third game. STORY: It all started in Nordic Cove, a small hamlet in the fictional state we all know today as “New York”. Once called New Hamburgerstand in the early A.D. years, it flourished with fur trades and Bacon Cheeseburgers. It was also home to the gravesite of a crusty, sorcerous, evil-naughty-person; the Viking warlord “Helfdane the Terrible!” Helfdane’s tyranny of the New Land was halted during these very rough times due to bad planning, and terrible hygiene. Today, Bacon Cheeseburgers are still at an all-time high, and New North America is on the verge of being historically ♥♥♥♥♥-slapped. An archaeologist cork-sniffer named Dr. Howard Bre, and his lovely assistant, Kayte Sparo have disturbed this ancient gravesite. Thus, fulfilling a curse which reanimated Helfdane and his minions to rip the life force from beings starting with Nordic Cove! Holy crap! Kayte’s boyfriend, Paulie Chops, must find the help he needs to turn this around, stat! This is their date night after all. Don’t act like you’ve not had a night like this. Alright! YOU deal with that Helfdane thing. We’re getting Bacon Cheeseburgers and staying warm. We’ll be cheering for you! GAMEPLAY: The Curse of the Nordic Cove is a game, by gamers, for gamers. There are familiar elements of gameplay for all gaming fans from First Person Shooter, Sports, Puzzle-Solving, to Driving, Strategic Shooting and Stealth and Dungeon Crawling. This and more thrown at you, the player, in an eccentric and thrilling Survival-Horror game like no other. Using your choice of controls being Keyboard/Mouse combo or Gamepad, you maneuver the various characters through each level to complete a task and survive. All along the way, each character you control encounters enemies of various forms that will not hesitate to attack. There are obstacles that you need to figure out how to overcome.

I saw it on the PAX East show floor last weekend and thought it was so bizarre, I had to tape it.” Jason Schrier - Kotaku “The Curse of Nordic Cove is a very unique title set in a world unlike anything you’ve probably seen or played before. Combining your golf (yes, golf) skills with your surely honed FPS talents to create a title that is borderline insanity…in a good way!

You’re told you are an astronaut inside some kind of alien structure hurtling towards Earth, but it’s also about something deeper than that.” Under the surface, there is a subtext about games themselves – “We are conditioned to expect death and doom. We’re resigned to it. At its heart, this story is about that state of mind and how it effects the way we view our experiences, in games and in life.

It's a great game for people who are new to VR. You are the Wizard protecting the castle from a merciless waves of lava boulders, bugs, Dragons and other creatures intent on destroying your castle. Once all the towers of the castle are destroyed it's Game Over! As an arcade-style game, playtime is about 5 minutes until your castle is obliterated, and then you can play it again. If you want to blow off some 'steam' after a long day and enjoy some “relaxing chaos” with cool physics, Cinders of Hades is the game for you! Because of the game's physics, no two games are identical, and this unpredictability makes game play even more fun!

Magic is your only defence against monsters, demons, beasts and occasionally even your neighbours. You live in a small cottage, far from the cutthroat madness where you’ll need to use your magical skills in your fight to stay alive. For now, you will visit the town, Baile An Dagda, meet other Draoi, learn new spells and venture on through the dangerous realms in An Domhan. Compete against other Draoi, practice your skills and earn both respect and fear. In our world, you can: Cast spells by carving them in the air with your bare hands. Spells are more powerful for the Draoi that can cast them with the precision and flair of only the mightiest practitioners. If you were born to do this, your enemies will know it. Experience the power as you summon elemental forces and unleash destruction on your enemies, heal your allies and protect what is yours (nothing better than flying into a battle and spewing a firestorm over your enemies before blasting them off to the horizon with a wave of your hand, hot, smoking and really quite upset) Enter dangerous battleground arenas, set in the raw landscape of An Domhan, where teams compete to vanquish (and ultimately humiliate) teams of lesser Draoi. Talk to those around you or coordinate with your team as you explore and battle.

293520,Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn,"May 27, 2015",50000 - 100000,4,0,14.99,0,"Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn is a first person hunting simulator where you hunt the largest and most dangerous creatures to ever exist – DINOSAURS. This game is a sequel of the original classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. It’s an authentic hunting simulation where you track and stalk your prey. Careful and thoughtful consideration must be taken during the hunt; to survive you'll need to know your preys temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings (you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end being lunch). Remember you're not hunting deer, you're hunting dinosaurs. You’ll visit huge, beautifully rendered and realistic 3D environments, each with their own unique Eco systems. There are pristine beaches, dense jungles, pine forests, muddy marshes, rocky plains and deserts to explore. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. Players can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth and land elevation will give you a sound advantage over some of the more vicious dinosaurs. Choose between a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, a silent crossbow or tranquilizer gun, which puts your prey to sleep instead of killing it. You can also carry sidearms. Some of your equipment includes a handheld Gadget, which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking the beasts easier, Cover Scent which masks your smell and numerous other goodies, which will prove indispensable for your hunting adventure. There is a wide variety of different dinosaurs to hunt each with unique behaviors and intelligence. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species , each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, while others will become enraged and attack. During your adventure you'll experience everything from 'pea-brained' dummies to cunning dinosaurs, with heightened senses of sight, hearing and smell. So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently, otherwise you might be the one being hunted. key Features: Hunt the largest and most ferocious animals known to man – the Dinosaurs! Huge 3D Free-Roaming Open worlds. Beautiful and realistic high definition graphics. A multitude of different Dinosaurs, from Herbivorous (plant eating) to the Carnivorous (meat Eating). Realistic AI – Dinosaurs react to sight, sound and smell, each with their own mannerisms and Behaviors. Explore and hunt in different Eco-systems including jungles, forests, beaches and rolling Hills. Equip camouflage and Cover Scent to even the odds. A variety of weapons and equipment to choose from (from Sniper Rifle to Cross-bow). Map and Radar to locate and track Dinosaurs. Use tranquilizer darts instead of bullets (experience the thrill of the hunt without the killing).

1694430,Dynamic Dungeons Editor,"Oct 31, 2021",0 - 20000,24,0,29.99,1,"Dynamic Dungeons Editor is a local tabletop tool that was developed for game masters who use a TV or projector to map different premade backgrounds, videos, and images. Animations and particle effects, tokens, and audio files can be used to immerse your players. It's a player, not a 3d map-building software. Both the demo and the full version contain only a few simple battle grids, so you will need the videos or static battle maps of Dynamic Dungeons or other creators. This software is in constant development, future updates will be free. Import Dynamic Dungeons maps or your own images or video files into the storyline and make a playlist, cover and reveal areas with the fog of war tool, apply custom size hex or quad grid overlay. Playing on the Tv screen is easier than you think. Simply lay flat your TV. You can protect the screen with a cheap plexiglass sheet, and use dry or wet-erase markers on it, so miniatures and dice rolls won't damage the surface of the Tv. You can also project down the video onto a physical table with an HD projector. Please note, that it's not a VTT for online gaming. The Dynamic Dungeons Editor will help you to adjust the color of the videos and static maps, import png tokens to represent the players and their foes. You can play various ambient sounds and use particle effects to pimp up static or animated maps. A free modular dungeon pack is available for this software containing more than 100 png props like corridors and various chambers to build your own dungeon. (Although there are many customization options available and custom 2D maps can be created with the application, be aware that Dynamic Dungeons maps are not made with this app, but in various 3D software.

You can play at your own pace in normal mode or activate the speedrun mode and try to get the best medal. A ranking system is also present to compare your times with those of players around the world.

868060,Immortal Darkness: Curse of The Pale King,"Oct 17, 2018",0 - 20000,0,0,7.99,0,"Immortal Darkness: Curse of the Pale King is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler, that blends the best of old school dungeon crawlers with modern graphics, slick combat, and context driven audio. It features challenging real-time tactical combat, a wide variety of spells, and a dark and brooding dungeon full of lethal enemies, sadistic traps, and mind-bending puzzles. The world of Uuld is under siege by the Vampyr who have destroyed and devoured all but a few remaining strongholds of civilization. The world's last hope, Shade, an ancient and legendary vampire hunter, has been bitten in the last epic battle on the surface. You play as Shade now struggling against the vampiric curse, using it to heal yourself but at a terrible price. You must fight your way through a twisted labyrinth of horror and death to finally face the Pale King, lord of all Vampires, before succumbing to the vampiric curse yourself. Fools Rush In This is a game that will challenge you to think tactically about every situation. Rushing into a room without a good plan will most likely get you killed very quickly. Control the flow of combat by using spells and potions to slow, stun, confuse, poison, scatter, separate and take out your enemies a few at a time. The Thirst As a half-vampire your primary means of healing is drinking the blood of your fallen enemies. Using this ability pushes you closer and closer to full vampire. Use it sparingly or pay the price. There are ways to reduce your build-up of evil, such as potions and holy altars, but they are few and your enemies are many. Items are Everything With the exception of your basic melee attack, every spell and ability you will have is based on the items you choose to equip to the 6 slots in your action bar. As you progress through the game and your pack begins to fill with dozens of items, choosing what you equip to your action slots will define everything about how you play and what you can do. Secrets Within Secrets Few will find every secret or unlock every puzzle in this centuries old dungeon. Evil has been at work here since ancient antiquity and there is more concealed in this place of eternal gloom than anywhere else in Uuld. Decisions that Will Shape the Cosmos There are many factions at play here and who you decide to ally with and who you decide to oppose has the power to dramatically reshape your story and the fate of this world, and possibly many others.",['English'],['English'],“...

1284550,Geometric Feel the Beats,"Aug 19, 2020",0 - 20000,0,0,1.99,0,"Have fun destroying your enemies in a reinterpretation of games from the 80s! To the sound of a mixture of unique musical genres, complete missions, improve your ship, be precise in your shots. All of this without worrying about GAME OVER! Play alone, in cooperative mode or challenge a friend in PVP mode, here competition is what counts! Regardless of how you choose to play, the fun has no limits! - Game Details: Inspired by a space theme and with touches of “Tron” (we love this movie!) The game is focused on fun and competition accompanied by frantic songs. Don't you like to die again and again? Then your problems are over! In 'Geometric Feel The Beats' you don't have to worry about that, you have fun doing the missions and collect points. Accumulating ranking points is not just for you to show others your ranking, they are also for buying upgrades for your spaceship. Using ranking points can make you drop some rankings, so analyze the timing of the purchase well, but buying upgrades makes your life easier in the game. Here you decide! Stay tuned to the Power up’s that appear in the stage, they are accompanied by big surprises! Game Modes: Adventure: Perfect for “lone wolves”, in this mode each stage is made up of two missions. You will have fun discovering new “AIs” and finding ways to overcome them. Co-op: In cooperative mode you start from scratch again. It does not take into account your advancement, upgrades or adventure mode ranking, but there is a crucial difference ... YOU WILL NOT BE ALONE! A friend will accompany you, helping you in the challenges of adventure mode, because everything is more fun with a friend! In this mode we have an exclusive ranking for players and their friends and the rules for purchasing upgrades remain the same. With teamwork you have achieved scores never imagined before! PVP: Who doesn't like to compete against a friend? In this mode, hitting your opponent gives you an advantage, he will be paralyzed for a few seconds while you complete your mission! There will be three missions per game, the one who wins the most missions wins. The rules remain the same as for adventure and the mission is the same for both players. Who will win this duel? – Ranking Who will remain at the top? Who will be the fastest and most accurate player? These questions will be answered here! There will be two classifications, one for adventure mode and one for cooperative. In advance, we warn you that the more you miss, the more points you will lose, which could cause the ranking to drop. - Steam Community: Between one explosion and another, we would like to see your most fun moments during the game.

924670,Need for Spirit: Drink & Drive Simulator/醉驾模拟器,"Sep 5, 2018",0 - 20000,0,0,0.99,0,"Need for Spirit: Drink &amp; Drive Simulator is a tongue-in-cheek racer, unique through its approach to the racing topic. You step into the shoes of a hapless professional driver tasked with transporting various alcoholic beverages such as beer, spirits, wine and brandy to certain venues like birthdays and other miscellaneous celebrations. If you thought this mission will be easy, think again. The infrastructure will be challenging to say the least. Country roads, mountains and highways that resemble dirt roads will all prove to be worthy adversaries on your path towards a successful delivery. Abysmal roads aside, the biggest enemy will be your very own addiction to the booze you’re transporting. Potholes seem harmless after you’ve transformed into an insatiable drunkard which suddenly thinks that he’s got the off-road skills to take as many shortcuts as needed. The most inaccessible corners of the map no longer seem like obstacles. Really, what are YOU waiting for? Rev that engine, empty a couple of bottles and put your own skills to the test in a parody that absolutely does not encourage drunk driving in real life. Stick to video games and that hangover will disappear faster than flipping the wheels in this simulation! Key features : -          Unique gameplay featuring eight levels with deserts, forests, rural roads and highways. -          Three camera modes. -          Four booze types as the main commodity and foe. -          The high probability of experiencing drunk vision. -          Challenging driving highlighted by obstacles and time limits.","['English', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Traditional Chinese']",“醉汉视角的赛车游戏？Steam最近上线了一款非常魔性的独立搞笑游戏《醉驾模拟器》（《Need for Spirit: Drink &amp; Drive Simulator》），玩家扮演一名憨厚的货车司机师傅，游戏中最大的障碍是你浓郁的醉意[吐]，” 电玩巴士 - 520k followers on weibo - Alexa Rank - 20(global) “《醉驾模拟器》登陆Steam 深刻感悟醉驾带来的危害” GamerSky - Alexa Rank - 470(global) “DRIVING DRUNK?

The elites of the government hid behind a sham democracy, disconnected from the life the people were leading, and acted solely in their own interests. The regime considered the dissidents as conspiracy theorists, treated them like terrorists and locked them away in highly-secured prisons, to prevent them from telling the people the truth about the manipulating medias accomplice of the government power.

454330,A Room Beyond,"Jun 13, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,7.99,0,"A ROOM BEYOND, is fantasy point and click adventure based on essential subjects of human existence. This novel game draws the drama around the “Fog Wanderer”, a murderous apparition scaring a small village in a Lovecraftian world. Help the villagers to solve the murder mystery and discover your own fate which seems to be oddly woven into the entire drama. A philosophical story is built upon inspiration coming from the book The Top Five Regrets of the Dying . Videogames such as Alone in the Dark 1 , The Last Door and the famous Lucas Arts games significantly influenced the general tone and coloring of the game, as well as the art of H.P. Lovecraft and E.A. Poe . The game’s innovative mix of pixelart and low-poly rendering has attracted a lot of interest among players and artists. Synopsis When you awake, you find yourself trapped in a gloomy cave. Dim candle light reveals strange symbols and cult objects all over this place. You can’t remember what happened, but this place gives you shivers. There is a tiny ray of light in the distance which might lead to a room beyond this darkness. Outside the cave you find yourself in a forest which is surrounded by deep gorges and thick layers of fog. A crowd of people lives here in fear of an ominous apparition that creeps through the fog for manhunt. Help the villagers to solve the mystery of the murderous fog wanderer and uncover the fate that brings you to this place. Gameplay Simplified control of the game can be learned fast and allows a quick start. No strong prior experiences with computer games are needed for playing A Room Beyond. All interactions can be accomplished by clicking or dragging the mouse pointer. The game does not define specific timing so that players can take their time to explore the virtual world. Additonal game features are unlocked gradually while progressing storyline. Technology &amp; Style 2.5D Perspective: The game’s visual perspective is known as 2.5D, which describes a combination of 3D effects in a general 2D stage design. Both types bring their own benefits to the game: Interaction and navigation is easy in a 2D scenery, but visual perception of depth is increased by using 3D objects. Pixel Style: Manual and procedural processing steps create a mosaic-like pixel effect which results in a graphical abstraction that increases the scope of visual interpretation and stimulates players’ imagination. Combination of both, smooth animations brought by modern technology and the look and feel of retro pixel game design leads to a fresh contemporary graphic style.","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],"“Excellent cliff-hangers.

Each piece can be swapped by another piece. Select two segments to swap them. A segment will be highlighted by a green border if you hover over them. When they are swapping they will exchange their position in the level. The levels come in different kind of sizes and are different cut in segments from each other. By rearranging the level the player can collect all fruits to progress to the next level. The obstacles you meet are spikes and walking and jumping enemies. Use moving platforms to your advantage and collect keys to activate blocks. Be sure to click the tutorial button if you don’t know how to play.

Work with these factions via Phoenix Point's diplomacy system, use subterfuge to steal what you need from them, or simply crush all around you with military might. No matter what you choose, victory won't be easy. Phoenix Point Features: Tons of Content: Over two years of updates, upgrades, fixes, and new content suggested by our community, including Steam Workshop support for subscribing and enabling mods, tweaking existing mods, and setting up your game the way you want to play. Try our example 'Custom Camapign' mod to set up new unique campaigns. Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced. Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Engage with a complex narrative, complete with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via several playthroughs. Explore, research, and discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself. Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them. Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass. Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Integrating the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']","“Elegant, atmospheric, and energetic, [Julian] Gollop’s latest remains remarkably hard to put down.” 8/10 – PCGamesN “If you like XCOM then you’re going to love Phoenix Point.” 9/10 – Trusted Reviews “Phoenix Point is, without a doubt, one of the best strategy games to come out in the last few years.” 9/10 – Noisy Pixel",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/header.jpg?t=1658422567,https://phoenixpoint.info/,https://phoenixpoint.info/support,support@snapshotgames.com,True,True,False,74,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/phoenix-point?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,3087,1188,,47,3237,"Phoenix Point contains depictions of science-fiction combat, including the use of guns, energy weapons, explosives, melee weapons, and other military-style devices.

Great cheap price for something so enjoyable! ” 5 minutes of game: 'XWallpaper - это забавный и мощный движок для живых обоев, который отображает удивительные анимации и эффекты на ваших обоях с низкой загрузкой процессора.” (Translate: 'XWallpaper is a fun and powerful live wallpaper engine that displays amazing animations and effects on your low CPU wallpaper. ”) 爱の鉴赏家： ”推陈出新，她真的非常棒！初看到的时候我是有些不以为然的。因为动态壁纸领域，早有Wallpaper Engine作为领头老大哥，很多后起之秀，只不过都是模仿之作，而且其中大多数不过个赚个噱头，质量远远不如前者。可是当我实际用起这款软件，体验简直太棒了！如果非要说Wallpaper Engine有什么缺点，那就是能自由自在下到很多壁纸和壁纸素材，可是仅限于使用，玩家自己的可控性却很低。但是这个新秀，明显有意改善前辈的不足。她不仅仅可以对动态壁纸加入了大量的可控要素，甚至可以说将一些做图软件最实用的功能全都简化之后，再搬进来。在这款软件里，大佬固然可以大展身手，但是新丁也能够获得极佳的动态壁纸制作体验。另外，这款软件还主打一个新功能，就是支持鼠标的单独特效。正如软件介绍中写道：提供数百款漂浮粒子特效(200+)、滤镜特效(20+)、鼠标拖尾轨迹特效(200+)、鼠标点击交互特效(200+)，实则不虚。仅仅是简单的编辑，无论是壁纸还是鼠标点击，瞬间就酷炫了很多。如果想让你的桌面靓丽起来，如果想获得比Wallpaper Engine更好的自由度，这款XWallpaper或许能够成为你电脑桌面的超新星宠儿。“ 小熊饼干: '前所未有，真的，这个软件真的很厉害，Wallpaper Engine这个大家都知道，应该算是动态壁纸的标杆了，但对我来说它只是一个单纯提供别人制作的壁纸的软件，我很羡慕创意工坊里那些大神们制作的令人眼花缭乱的壁纸，美是很美，漂亮是漂亮，但缺少了某些东西，这些东西只有我自己懂，该如何做，当然是自己做一份满足自己的壁纸，但是，很难，对我来说太难了，我连业余都算不上，那些繁琐复杂的制作步骤让我望而却步。但是，xwallpaper能满足我 ，我相信，因为这种傻瓜式制作步骤简直是为我而生。 爱不释手啊爱不释手，轻便，对比Wallpaper Engine更低的cpu占用率，满足了对动态壁纸没有更高要求的人群，当然也满足了像我一样lj配置的爱好者，我不知道steam上还有没有其他的壁纸编辑软件，但这款，是真的打动了我。' 17173萤火虫： “一款UI精简清爽的动态壁纸软件，支持创意工坊，功能较丰富，玩家不仅能够找到适合自己的静态或动态壁纸，还可根据需要对图片进行单独的可视化设计，包括添加飘浮粒子，增加滤镜效果，甚至是改变鼠标的点击跟轨迹特效功能。既不占空间也不占内存，总的来说挺实用。。。。' 汉化语录: '《酷鱼动态壁纸》是最近由开发兼发行商XWidgetSoft发布的一款可编辑的动态桌面壁纸软件，使用者可以直接从软件的创意工坊查看动态壁纸的预览并下载，但它最大的优点是，使用者可以根据自己的喜好使用软件内置的各种视觉特效工具来把一张图片变成一个全新的动态壁纸，实现无穷多的可能性，并且产生的动态壁纸还可以直接上传到到创意工坊，软件在使用过程中CPU占用不多。。。' Blacklist_: “这是一款和《Wallpaper Engine》同类的桌面壁纸软件，不过内容上与ui都非常精简，支持创意工坊，壁纸的下载与更换都非常便捷，cpu的占用率也更加的低。但壁纸桌面预览功能个人感觉还不是很完善。 其次，还能够用基础图片自主设计自己的动态壁纸，并可以根据自己的喜好添加特效，鼠标指针的点击，运行轨迹等等也可以设计自己喜欢的特效，支持云，能够上传供其他用户下载。值得尝试的一个软件。”","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/header.jpg?t=1607489848,http://xdesktop.com,http://xdesktop.com,xdesktop@outlook.com,True,False,False,0,,0,72,71,,0,128,,557,0,557,0,XDesktop,XDesktop,"Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Includes level editor","Animation & Modeling,Design & Illustration,Utilities","Utilities,Design & Illustration,Animation & Modeling","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_b1d3ea368506ed2b572b52a4cd621f9da8a4e15f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_025bb72d196d33192359941d50e193660e5a4905.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_fc75e7674c6504cd05ebc2e976c531d0ea7ecb41.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_63814f52104617fd5f68d16c4fd413c4b1b71879.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_7300607954b6ed31a34928f73819544f9cc4138d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_fb5b1c59896c570e5a8b71a4a24acfdd4dc620d2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_76d879d21a0f279274aec1fd01d5d64fcfe32e6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_ba24ba3fcd7e17b09f271fa37a3d37aa52aece7f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_ef6f30cb676e63f06b3fd30bd3014833b5e8efec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_1b451cd8d843c95637e4247f7c7b980862cf7dd8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_56516ca22d95c97a99d7e047423842f8eee09ca9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256758665/movie_max.mp4?t=1565795573,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256758342/movie_max.mp4?t=1565100720,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256763932/movie_max.mp4?t=1570438319,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256763944/movie_max.mp4?t=1572261239,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760117/movie_max.mp4?t=1566747400,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256757970/movie_max.mp4?t=1567605898,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759660/movie_max.mp4?t=1566699139,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759351/movie_max.mp4?t=1566175333,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759081/movie_max.mp4?t=1565798208"

As you cultivate and train the newest generation of young pop stars , you'll have to decide who to hire and who to fire, who gets promoted when things go well and who gets reprimanded when things get sour. The personal lives of these young celebrities are a part of your business, and the life of a pop star isn't always a happy one. Their crowning personal achievements can be your greatest commercial successes, but their emotional meltdowns and PR nightmares can spell financial disaster for your company. It's not just the idols you have to worry about. The world is full of gossip magazines , super fans , and rival groups , all thirsty for a scoop on the latest scandal . There's a lot of people who want to tear you down and are willing to play dirty, but try not to let it get to you. It's not personal, it's business. Features Decide how to deal with crises including gossip, vandalism, stalkers, or threats directed at your agency and the pop idols you manage. Manage relationships between the different idols in your group, as you deal with cliques, internal feuds, and bullying.

1408480,Sneaky Kitten,"Dec 24, 2021",0 - 20000,0,0,5.99,0,"Sneaky Kitten is a family-friendly non-violence game, where you play as a cat to collect coins and other trinkets. Do this by solving problems and sneaking past some non-friendly dogs. Play as a cat! Have fun playing as a cat! Experience the excitement of being a fluffy cat who can run and jump around in fun levels. The goal of the game is to sneak around the enemies (that are dogs) and steal their treasures. Exciting stealth gameplay Dogs are patrolling the area around the treasures. To steal them you have to be very sneaky to pass the dogs, finding paths where the dogs can't spot you and sometimes distract them from their original path, then quickly sneak past them before they come back to spot you. Non-Violence We know that most family-friendly games today include violence. Our philosophy at Eight Lives is to avoid violence, which is why we have made Sneaky Kitten without violence.

929570,A Familiar Fairytale Dyslexic Text Based Adventure,"Nov 18, 2019",0 - 20000,0,0,0.99,0,"This game was created to help others feel the frustration of having dyslexia. You play as a small fox a fairytale story with Kings, Queens, and witches. This game is a text-based adventure created with the intention of allowing the user to experience the frustration of being dyslexic. Sentences and words are made intentionally hard to read through different rules of how they are constructed change with every chapter, ranging from a flickering background, jittery letters and PQBS's being swapped around. Choices must be made in a quick time which leads to even more frustration. Much like a book, you could skip to the end of this game thought the chapter select menu but this is supposed to simulate the fact that you can do this but don't get any satisfaction from doing so. You can re-read chapters to see if you can get a better outcome. There are a bunch of options to try to make the game easier to play based on people's common conceptions on what fixes dyslexia. There is an option to add a colored overlay and remove the flicker in an attempt to combat 'Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome/ Irlen Syndrome'. And there is an option to change the font to Open Dyslexic which in my opinion is harder to read. There are options which allow you to play the game in non-dyslexic mode if you want, but wheres the fun in that. The game includes a range of accessibility settings. Color Overlays Page Flicker Off Open Dyslexia Font Text To Speech We don't claim to be actually like what a dyslexic persons sees, but merely a simulation of the frustration.

485980,Syrian Warfare,"Feb 21, 2017",200000 - 500000,45,0,13.99,3,"This war has been going on for a long time, and it's hard to say when it will be over. We got so used to it that news from Syria has become trivial. We've even already forgotten how it all started, and where the roots of the terrible terror lie – the terror that swept across Europe in recent years. Syria is all over the news, and it's become a subject of many documentaries. We, however, want to show the story through the lens of the game and don't let the word 'game' mislead you. This game does not claim to be a history lesson, but it shows the course of the war in all its seriousness through the major milestones, from the first days till the latest important victories over terror. What kind of a game is it? Syrian Warfare is a real time strategy with a high degree of realism. This game is not about a base construction or units production. The player will have to determine their forces characteristics before they go into action. And during the mission, they would be able to select reinforcements in order to support the troopers. The troops and machinery crews move from mission to mission and gain experience, which helps them increase their effectiveness. Trophies captured by the player on the battlefield can be used throughout the whole campaign. Importantly enough, there are no «life bars» for vehicles in the game. Damages are calculated by taking into account the protection module and the power of adverse factors. Inflicted damages affect the functioning of the module. In the battlefield, it is impossible to repair the armor, but one can repair the modules by using a limited stock of spare parts. Ammunition and fuel are also limited. A system of high-quality physical demolition of buildings and other objects is used in the game (it does not only look spectacular, but it has a serious influence on the tactics during the missions, especially in urban areas). The game has a wide set of tactical possibilities: The storming of buildings, usage of smokescreens, infantry lift by helicopters and APC/IFV, air strike calls, capturing of trophy weapons and equipment, usage of heat flares and active defense complexes. And of course the story itself. We will try to show the conflict, not from a point of view of a general, located somewhere at the ‘top’. No, it will be a story of a man, who lived in the country that descended into hell. A story of struggle, loss and regained hope.","['English', 'Russian', 'German', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","“Качественная реалистичная RTS, практически не имеющая современных аналогов и конкурентов и способная растопить сердце самого либерального любителя стратегий.

Upgrade and build your roster of available Mechs from over 80 unique parts, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and playstyles. From flamethrowers to mega missile pods, fighter drones to rayguns, determining the right Mech build and leveraging its weaponry is key to conserving your resources and defeating The Swarm. Mech Armada offers deep grid-based, turn-based combat, where there are no perfect solutions to the challenges you face. Understanding your enemy and anticipating their actions, getting to know the limitations of your Mechs while managing your resources and observing the terrain ahead of you will determine your success. At the end of each area, you’ll need to take on The Swarm’s major bosses: they're massive, ugly and ridiculously tough. Are you up to the task? No two runs in Mech Armada are the same. With procedurally generated levels set across a backdrop of varied post-apocalyptic environments, every element in the game is randomly combined and balanced to create a unique, challenging experience. Like all rogue-likes, death in Mech Armada means game over. You’ll need to try again with an entirely new run, with fresh Mechs and all new encounters. Wanting to try new tactics, Mech designs and strategies without risk? Head to the Sandbox, where you can pick any parts you want. Practice your maneuvers, experiment with unique loadouts and refine your strategies against The Swarm.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Latin America']","['English', 'Spanish - Latin America']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1389360/header.jpg?t=1655399045,https://mecharmada.com,https://mecharmada.com,support@lioncodegames.com,True,False,False,0,,0,264,46,,37,274,,241,0,358,0,Lioncode Games,Lioncode Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on TV","Indie,RPG,Strategy","Mechs,Turn-Based Tactics,Rogue-lite,Roguelike Deckbuilder,Strategy,Character Customization,Procedural Generation,Post-apocalyptic,Deckbuilding,Sci-fi,Turn-Based Strategy,Turn-Based,Rogue-like,Turn-Based Combat,Isometric,Replay Value,Singleplayer,3D,RPG,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1389360/ss_79aa6b273aed8e283bfeb8f28ee244000fc201c1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655399045,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1389360/ss_a40df9f13f8b20bc26bf7c74599b593fb65fd917.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655399045,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1389360/ss_81c52b2db3b0acc88762dc166d6bd5776331da7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655399045,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1389360/ss_f450725ac8d6d7cbe1995b06ac451278ba326436.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655399045,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1389360/ss_a5a35d7ae89730ac758e91133153e1f5dbd6eaed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655399045,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1389360/ss_3663aaa5f5854fb98d4fb6a4df7065c31d7bc711.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655399045,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1389360/ss_9e86f1723f89bb76e0cc349aa4161db518f5adf2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655399045,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1389360/ss_e9080fda49b2e484ace5121daa727df5cfc6b787.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655399045,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1389360/ss_3d869e4ea1d822bc4cc0a4d2f429f3dc9a45e6f1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655399045","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256891887/movie_max.mp4?t=1655241714,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256845618/movie_max.mp4?t=1628201853,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256838451/movie_max.mp4?t=1623434726"

The AI of the units allows them to help each other during a battle, repair broken buildings, etc. Game networking supports up to 8 players. The game mechanics allow players to declare (or break) political alliances. There are 5 campaigns and 30 maps in the game. With the map editor built into the game, you can just keep adding more maps. Graphics: 2D isometric Screen Resolution: any Technologies of Programming: C++ and Assembly This project began in the late 90's, when games focused on game play with only 8-bit graphics. Games such as 'Warcraft 2' and 'Age of Empires 1' emerged as a sensation because of their clever game play. Beating this game with it's brutal efficiency and crafty knack for making shrewd decisions is quite a challenge. The AI is quite intelligent and even I, as the author, can't win with more than 3 computer opponents. The game AI plays without cheating. It doesn't fudge resources nor spy on the player. I stress tested my server using a few of my friends. It’s possible that efficiency issues may pop up with a larger number of players. Just be aware that I’m entirely aware of this potential problem and will be looking out for it. Any problems that do appear will be dealt with promptly.","['English', 'Russian']","['English', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/633660/header.jpg?t=1510336842,http://onimod.land,http://onimod.land,support@astralax.com,True,False,False,0,,0,14,3,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Astralax,Astralax,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Includes level editor",Strategy,"Strategy,RTS","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/633660/ss_377917bdecd6735e836b7fa7b6b1797b8657dd9e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510336842,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/633660/ss_64b263751d5704df36a0266c69108d0da5a68313.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510336842,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/633660/ss_2d7a9ac7e703182bcccae372a2107735fbdbebf9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510336842,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/633660/ss_fa99ccaec23bbb89ded2b71e1e0e7adee1b08106.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510336842,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/633660/ss_2c0f741d50010d86fd00dde087eee4662c0f53bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510336842","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256687740/movie_max.mp4?t=1508603967,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256687977/movie_max.mp4?t=1508603976"

The floorplan generator can be used to quickly draw and print an encounter floorplan for your favorite pen and paper roleplaying game. It is very quick and easy to create a simple floorplan, you just select what terrain type each square should be and the program fixes the rest. E.g. a cave wall next to a rocky ground will automatically create a jagged wall, but the same cave wall next to a marble floor would create a much smoother wall because this is likely to be an indoor room with polished walls. About 50 different terrain types to choose from Icons included for the most common objects, e.g. doors, stairs, tables, beds, trees, bushes, pentagrams Color maps or old school black and white style Adjacent terrains interact automatically to create jagged edges, smooth transitions and shadows when necessary Random fractals used to create shapes for cave walls, rivers and other non regular terrains Create a multi-page pdf with the dungeon divided into pages suitable for printing Export dungeon as a single png suitable for Foundry VTT, Roll20, Fantasy Grounds and similar applications Export wall data that can be used for dynamic lightning in Foundry VTT or Roll20 (requires roll20 pro subscription) Configurable square and paper sizes, (default is 1 inch squares on A4 pages) Outdoor and dungeon shadows with configurable strength Export to your favorite paint program for finishing touches Import your own icons Create new terrain types from imported images Configurable grid, default is to not draw it on top of walls and with thicker lines between pages Grid based, terrain is placed in squares or on square edges (icons can be placed and rotated freely) Shortcuts to quickly put a random door, tree or bush in a square Dungeon layout can be imported from a simple ASCII text file, like this Create random dungeons automatically Editor to create rules for your own random dungeon Color dungeons can be converted to Black &amp; White style dungeons automatically Export with a 3d look Steam workshop support",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/header.jpg?t=1648049497,http://www.illwinter.com/floorplan,,support@illwinter.com,True,True,True,0,,0,370,28,,0,384,,1608,0,3145,0,Illwinter Game Design,Illwinter Game Design,Steam Workshop,"RPG,Design & Illustration,Utilities","Design & Illustration,RPG,Utilities,Software","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_d3671c8562e8b8c1fcb9fd3af14ad2df4a4594e0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_a3c03579b273c27dfa8ec07a05e3491568b2e4e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_c05527508f294cf79590a187b702f75316d96dee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_14af3e7235050a557c2c16e56ab680719952d5e5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_aaa501cfd06e98f05b2547b418986c1d19b2872a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_a3b8ea5e84a9c781980f67646a731e9c08a15b72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_7af1a3027a4ff21ee35bb151b0142522ad1e3a44.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_bfb6bc5dbe2d33c851d072816d4d68735a6e205c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_80d4fa28d8975eed9b2d176a569137d19fa22936.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_09967a891ac654bfed9c86e8955bc812add62123.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_250c0522399019c3497271bed4f80b8c92815d22.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_9c0d76e3ce261c627eaf5f129c42e70aeb790ca6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_4c77fbc1f14c6ff47e5698c9cfe3cd1462cfb3ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_a3e6b66291e672704568a168df78c2055cd4f94f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_72d0a12be34f837f4fad3831362e0881014aa916.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_609cdc8b2a7c0c2d6815221745fe7319c48375b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_47691f57dd37d95afa6d3b32ea1cd024530653ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_72274e32b1615ec842685a01e570b4f258c565d2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_449a81adc6b86d5c65f79ae1aba14442076892cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256713923/movie_max.mp4?t=1523394609

OCHITSUBAKI is a game about the impossibility of translating trauma. It is also about two-tailed catboys, gods with cloud hair, and slapfights. ​ TW: CSA, animal death, violence, suicidal ideation ​════*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*════​ OCHITSUBAKI || 落ち椿 is a visual novel about the impossibility of translating trauma. It is a bilingual JPN/ENG game about translation and how it can run as deeply as the way hypermarginalized people constantly 'translate' their identities and trauma for the understanding of others, no matter how far it is from the source material. It's about recovering from trauma through the genuine compassion and consideration of another person, who manages to See the aftereffects of trauma and are willing to meet that person's unique needs, regardless of if they 'understand' them or not. ════*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*════ Hanashiro (he/she/they) and their few remaining kin all react differently to the trauma of being immortal and witnessing the apocalypse over and over again in different cycles of reincarnation. Shiragiku is unfazed and cheery and flippant and whimsical and capricious; Shirayuri is nowhere to be found; and Hanashiro? Hanashiro is planning on their death in 10 years, when the camellias fall, if they cannot find a reason to live by then. Hanashiro and Shirayuri have witnessed THE END OF THE WORLD before. But no one believed them. Shiragiku has seen many, many apocalypses, but she has never been hurt by any one after the first. Shiragiku has remembered every single end; Shirayuri has remembered none; and Hanashiro only remembers some. Which? Even he doesn't know. Hanashiro misses speaking her fey mother tongue, but she can't seem to find anyone willing to listen to her, not even her own kind. And then she makes an enemy who just might. Their name is Lun Kochouran. And they might be the first one in a millennium to learn the Amayuri tongue. They also might be the first to kill an immortal. ════*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*════ Ochitsubaki is only loosely a visual novel, which is to say it is a story-based game with a strong aesthetic component. Ochitsubaki has a deep, rich tapestry of aesthetics in unifying modern elegance with unique retro anime-inspired character portraits. The original soundtrack derives inspiration from traditional Asian pentatonic scales, particularly but not limited to Japanese ones, that also derive a modern, Genshin's Liyue-type twist that sets it firmly in contemporary times. It has three language options: JPN, ENG, and JPN translation. The ENG/JPN versions are two different renditions of the story, thus requiring a separate JPN translation, emulating what happens when you try to translate something as complex as identity. You can consider that the only real choice you make in the game is which language to play it in, and each language option provides a different 'route,' a similar but very distinctly different iteration of the story. The language modes mimic the powerful loss that happens when stories--when trauma--is translated.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/header.jpg?t=1639786213,https://feyxuan.com,,contact@feyxuan.com,True,True,False,0,,0,2,1,,0,0,"This game contains a character who was sexually abused as a child and metaphorical references to that abuse, and it also contains violence",0,0,0,0,FEYXUAN,FEYXUAN,Single-player,"Indie,RPG","LGBTQ+,Romance,Experimental,Story Rich,Stylized,Hand-drawn,Dark Fantasy,Surreal,Atmospheric,Fantasy,Magic,Dating Sim,Multiple Endings,Choices Matter,Singleplayer,2D,CRPG,RPG,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/ss_10a124a6f808ee1754b7007582e5723d94d065c4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639786213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/ss_bcc9e2b8884a63dc9fc46be56d5d62919be37b23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639786213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/ss_b51fe7ac2f66db6f811c099ea9241b087cd0d8c6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639786213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/ss_27131575951913dbe1adf280d8cecbeff6971f69.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639786213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/ss_3053d8973b1778507ecc0039fb3e3e4d2f12f6cb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639786213",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256825406/movie_max.mp4?t=1616469926

378360,Ymir,"Mar 16, 2019",50000 - 100000,51,0,34.99,0,"Ymir is a 4X multiplayer strategy game combined with a city builder where each player develops a civilization of Pigmen starting at the stone age. The game is divided in 2 main interfaces : a worldmap view and a regional view. Each world tile matches a unique procedurally generated isometric zone that can be explored, settled and built on by players. In each one players can find random resources such as ores , animals or plants depending on the climate, relief and vegetation of the region. Features Pigs with clothes. Multiplayer on local or persistent servers. Complex socio-economic simulator for a challenging city-building experience on its own. Technological evolution with hundreds to techs, from the stone age to post-iron age. Fully procedural worlds where each region is random and unique. 7 biomes, each one with its own specific resources to encourage player-trading. Advanced diplomatic and economic tools to setup treaties ( right of passage, taxes, payments, trade agreements... ) and trade routes between players. Real-time battles. WILL remain free of any pay-to-win . Economy No direct control over population and economy: They breed, age, work and buy things according to the simulation. Population divided in social classes with specific incomes, purchasing power and revenues. Dynamic resources prices based on supply/demand, rarity and production costs. Even player consumed resources are taken into account: materials for buildings have to be bough at their market prices, generating incomes to the producers and affecting the economy. A simulator instead of a set of independent game rules : all variables and actions influence each other in sometimes unpredictable ways that makes things frustratingly challenging. Producing too much of something can be as damaging as not enough making the logic of the game quite different from classic management games. ( ex: instead of having positive effects, distributing a new resource can actually destabilize your economy if you're not careful ) Military Real-time battles are not instantiated and actually take place in your cities. Build and customize your fortifications with walls, bridges, gates, stairs, towers and battlements. With the terrain tools, modify the terrain heights to take maximum advantage of natural defenses like cliffs and hill tops. Water forces troops to embark and cross with slow vulnerable rafts: dig canals around your forts, secure your bridges or build a citadel on a river-island with fortified bridges. A Strategic-tool allows players to design their local defensive strategy in each one of their cities in case of attack: creating defensive zones, setting troops initial deployment positions and setting their behavior in battle. Battles are not instantaneous and belligerents can send reinforcements while a battle is still in progress. Battles can include unlimited 'teams' at the same time, each one fighting according to its allegiances. Battle troops during a battle are all AI controlled ( so that battles can happen independently of the player's presence ). Dozens of unit types including mounted camels, elephants and armored mammoths. Main game modes Real-time mode : a 'classical' mode to be played alone or with a few friends, meant to be played with the permanent presence of all players and to be stopped/continued over several playing sessions. Persistent mode : a more 'MMO' mode where the game server is to be left running 24/7 at all times even when players are offline and where actions take much more time than in the real-time mode. Meant to be played with the maximum number of players on a day-to-day basis, with games lasting several weeks. IMPORTANT This game is a one-man project: development is slow. This game is likely to forever remain an experimental work-in-progress and to never reach the quality, stability and optimization of a finished product: buy it only if you think it's worth it NOW, and not based on future expectations. Playing solo is possible, but the main focus of this game is multiplayer. The game is available in more languages than English, but localization is done by the community and might be partial and incomplete.","['English', 'French']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/header.jpg?t=1576782152,http://ymir-online.com,https://discord.gg/cwJD5Ds,,True,False,False,0,,0,708,242,,1,699,,1917,0,1917,0,Thibaud Michaud,Thibaud Michaud,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP","Indie,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","City Builder,Colony Sim,Strategy,Multiplayer,Simulation,Economy,4X,Indie,Building,Early Access,Grand Strategy,Alternate History,Historical,Management,Massively Multiplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_22da41290897961174061cdc57f26ad7fb6bf757.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_d8c014cdd1ce3f04be51970d385f8db509a8128e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_f5880dd326249efa9324fe79a4f33ebfcd5e45b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_758f3e1416a884902843251d49b0dc6def59af0e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_7a1aeda33713a33426abaaebfe7dad4f6f936063.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_38380234469d636ab5353319c3a18231f81dda9c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_6f533aaf3173b8ca6c44e6d22c694632177a58c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_4ce9d8f810296238bb05ce408e162e479250ab18.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_ae7a71a141adf672d7c358e410d5d99b848c22d7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_148138b946974a4b0d86f3a619b6b01f1159d2a7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_177b14440b201e4f99ab621dd6cd22ddfc17b24a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_bc6b10f6a81c8906ae40efba0b94136e3d891f43.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_824d7038fc7dcb9c20cb3d4c3b7ad8375ea84207.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_d947e7a95999be0ce04d5318fe545932ca919f61.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_308702bdbf8161d09793e20d27cc6922e1269db4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_14f56a26f3c36ddab7901e170744599cd96e5882.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_0e637330160c80683c9588f4a7ffc6b679388487.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_5d644b7e58eff0570a31319cffb0910dce7f5cb0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_9309eed30297e65e32979c8693453e9eda1707aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_6887356bd76abf941a1e74798dd07d303a7ebd33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256743714/movie_max.mp4?t=1550859206,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689157/movie_max.mp4?t=1552234573"

Journey from planet to planet, each procedurally generated with unique environments, challenges, and alien creatures. Explore Scout out the richest resources and the deadliest critters, and discover unique challenges and powerful artifacts. Extract You're going to need all the Ore and Crystal you can carry if you're going to mount a successful defense or purchase the upgrades you'll need to make it home alive. Excape Err... Escape. The resources on each planet won't last forever, but the alien creatures willing to bite your legs off never seem to end, eventually overwhelming even the most stalwart crew. Hold out as long as you can... but don't throw your resources - or the lives of your crew - away to a lost cause. Always be prepared to make a timely exit when things start getting hairy. Key Features Permadeath - If your crew does get eaten by aliens, or your ship is destroyed, that's game over. Procedurally generated - Each play through presents you with a uniquely generated region of space full of new planets, each with different benefits and risks. Pick up and play - Sure there are hordes of creatures out to get you, but From Orbit is still accessible to a broad range of players, even if you don't have much experience with RTS games, or find the complexity of mainstream RTS's off-putting. Set your own pace: rush headlong into danger, or set up your defenses and fortify your position. Planetary Environments - Arid deserts, frigid ice worlds, or lush forests... each with unique challenges and obstacles, and each complete with their own set of hostile critters. From Desert Beetles to Ice Worms, every type of creature you encounter has its own strengths and weaknesses that you'll need to adapt to in order to survive. Equipped with a powerful Omnisuit , any crew member can switch roles at a moment's notice ensuring you've always got the right tools for the job. Harvester The reason we're out here on the space frontier in the first place... resources! Expedient resource collection is the foundation of survival, required to construct defenses and purchase upgrades. Defender Stand on the front line, keeping your crewmates safe with your force shield and blaster. Clear the path to resources so your Harvesters can go to work. Engineer Construct automated harvesters, turrets, and other mechanical devices. Repair your constructions... or your ship. Nobody's going home if your way off the planet is destroyed.

Sable's Grimoire is a visual novel series set in a fantasy world filled with magic and monsters. It follows the adventures of Sable, a young human who wants to become a magic researcher, during his time at Amadronia Academy. Sable spends his everyday life at Amadronia surrounded by demi-humans, including elves, pixies, and succubi, as he learns more about this magical world and the creatures within it. As their first year together at Amadronia Academy comes to an end, Lisha and Sable make plans to spend their upcoming break together in her home. An elven village far away from their noisy classmates, where they can enjoy the break in peace, and be alone together at last. What awaits them at their destination, however, is not the holiday they had planned. Their time away is soon spoiled by news of recent kidnappings and graves being robbed. To make matters worse, these crimes are alleged to have been committed by a dark elf. Keen to investigate these incidents, Sable and Lisha move from town to town as they encounter one shocking revelation after another: mind control, forbidden magic, a human town where magic is the norm, and another side to her father's past which Lisha knew nothing about.

There's a wide range of difficulty levels so you can start simple then build your skill to experience the full depth of the game. Destroy Enemy Space Stations Command two groups of ships to attack and destroy enemy space stations. With a bit of practice you'll quickly learn where to place each ship, when to attack what turret and how to counter their abilities, the hard part is mastering it. Only the enemy turrets have abilities so you must be extra focused on using your units as a team and their positioning. Dodge projectiles the best you can and when you make a mistake move a ship to safety and another one in to take some hits. Just Get to the Exit! Navigate through different randomly setup star maps to get to the exit and win. They have fixed layouts but the rewards and exit point are in randomized locations. Some rewards will help you and some will harm you. The better you think, plan and understand what to do the more prepared you will be. Even a slight difference in the layout of the star map can greatly change how you play it. Don't worry though they are relatively easy to understand you just have to remember to take a moment to stop and think.

292180,X-Plane 10 Global - 64 Bit,"Jul 14, 2014",100000 - 200000,1,0,0.0,31,"X-Plane 10 Global is the latest version of a simulator that has been in development continuously for almost 20 years. This latest version of X-Plane 10 brings numerous improvements and enhancements for PC, Mac and Linux virtual pilots, unleashing the power of modern systems with its 64 bit processing and multi-core support. Designed to be the most flexible flight simulator it has a fully open structure that allows the enthusiast to change every part. With thousands of compatible add-ons there is no kind of flying craft that is not simulated and there is a whole world to explore. Boasting a 20 year old pedigree, X-Plane utilizes Incredible cloudscapes to bring the sky to life whilst the ground depicts real-world roads, cities, towns and more to ensure the most realistic flying experience possible. The completely new rendering engine shows the world around you in high detail and with global illumination so lights behave like real lights. The core is a virtual wind tunnel that creates the most realistic flight modeling available on a desktop. Equally capable of simulating every type of aircraft, the virtual pilot is able to experience the challenges of flying big airliners or tiny ultra-light aircraft. The realism of X-Plane 10 Global is proven by the fact that X-Plane is used as a certified training tool. Each aircraft flies just as it should, from the glider to the Space Shuttle! Air Traffic Control will guide you from startup to shut-down and also controls the other aircraft around you. Those other aircraft are not robotic as they are in other simulators, but they interact with the world in the same way as your own aircraft does. They will fight the same cross winds and turbulence as you encounter, they will need more runway to stop when the weather conditions are not favorable. Just like real pilots do, you will watch their take-off to be prepared for what your take-off will be like. It’s still simulated but it gets very close to real aviation! X-Plane 10 Global is built with the future in mind and makes full use of the hardware in your system. If you own a fast multi-core machine you will be able to simulate more aircraft around you and see more details but even with a moderate machine X-Plane 10 Global is capable of displaying a tremendous amount of objects without slowing down. Features Super accurate flight characteristics using a virtual wind tunnel Includes 30 aircraft, from gliders to the Space Shuttle Online flying with other virtual pilots Air Traffic Control actually controls the other aircraft around you Accurate terrain, roads and more Global ‘Plausible World’ auto generated scenery New rendering engine with innovative global lighting 64 Bit optimized Totally flexible and extendable with thousands of existing add-ons (and many more to come) Includes super-detailed scenery for Nice (LFMN), Paderborn-Lippstadt (EDLP) and Faro (LPFR) printed “Quick Start Guide” included Default Scenery Having installed the software via Steam you only have the main simulator as well as the Seattle region. More scenery has been divided into various free and optional DLCs.

Mobius, ruler of all dimensions, has gone mad with power and is sending an army to destroy the Aether!  You must vanquish their evil minions by shifting between the very fabric of reality and using their one weakness against them - cold hard steel.  As an Aether Guardian, Jhin can use her 'Aether Slip' to tackle the unseen menace that is assaulting the Aether and save everyone from Mobius's wrath. ​ Features: - Fast-paced, challenging gameplay with tight, responsive controls - Swap between dimensions at will - 9 Different Arenas to Test Your Skills - 6 Unique Guardians to Play As  ( and 1 Secret Character ) - Two Intense Bossfights - Competitive Online Highscores for Each Arena - Moon Launchers ( They Shoot Moons at You! ) - 20 Insanely Hard Challenges - Over 70 unlockable Cheat Codes Controller Support (Xbox, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, GameCube) *may work with off-brand, but no guarantee Local Splitscreen Multiplayer     - 14 Multiplayer Arenas    - Co-Op, Head To Head, King of the Hill, Rifts, and Hot Potato Game Modes    - Custom Match Settings, Powerups, etc Singleplayer: In Aether Drift, you must survive for as long as possible in one of 9 Arenas. Waves of Mobius's soldiers will constantly attack you, so you must do your best to defeat them! The difficulty ramps up over time, up to ludicrous amounts at Max Level. Multiplayer: There are also 6 multiplayer modes that can be played with 2 - 4 players. Co-Op has players competing for highscore in the singleplayer arenas. Unlike singleplayer, this mode lets players revive their fallen comrades. Stock and Timed Modes pit players against each other in a battle to the death in one of 14 multiplayer Arenas. Rifts makes players search across the Arenas for capture points which they must fight for control over. King of the Hill spawns one Rift in the center of the map, and players must fight for control over it. Hot Potato mode places a Potato on the first player hit, which can pass to others by hitting them. After a predetermined time the potato detonates, killing all nearby players in a spuddy explosion. Last one standing wins. ** This game is LOCAL only! ** Additional Content: The game features 20 challenges, each of which will test your skills and agility. Beating them unlocks cheat codes for the game, which can be used to modify both singleplayer and multiplayer to a hilarious degree. NOTE: This game works best on DESKTOPS! Do not be fooled into thinking it will work well on laptops. It WON'T. For more information, visit the Toxic Sasquatch website!

This game showcases the revolutionary Freedom Locomotion System that provides you with a wide range of options, which will allow you to find the most immersive fit regardless of how motion sickness sensitive you might be. The Freedom Locomotion System puts CAOTS (Controller Assisted On The Spot) at the front and center of the system. This is a form of walking in place locomotion solution where to move, you simply walk, jog or run on the spot, allowing you to walk, jog or run in VR. This also has the benefit of allowing you to traverse large open world VR spaces in an immersive manner while been less likely to get motion sick than traditional sliding VR locomotion solutions. For those that prefer a less active solution, or are still susceptible to motion sickness even while walking on the spot, the system provides Dash and Blink steps that are derived from teleportation schemes that have been proven effective in not causing motion sickness.

227160,Kinetic Void,"Nov 21, 2014",100000 - 200000,0,0,19.99,0,"About Kinetic Void Kinetic Void is a 3D space adventure with a focus on customization and exploration. The shipyard allows players to construct their ship piece by piece. Ships can be as simplistic as a cockpit, a hull, a engine and a gun, or as complex as a player wants. Each module has available subsystems which can be applied to strengthen specific attributes of the ship, and when damaged, those subsystems may be destroyed. While in space flight, interactions between objects are governed by the physics engine. Running into an asteroid at high speed will damage your ship, potentially with catastrophic effects. Using the Kinetic Field Generator (KFG) in game will allow your ship to create an artificial gravity around the ship, both protecting the ship as well as allowing your ship to fly freely through space. This field will also enable the Micro Warp Drive, catapulting your ship far into space in a matter of seconds. Kinetic Void is a procedurally generated adventure, there is no main story line. The decisions and direction is left up to the player. Ally with factions, go to war, build your ship and amass wealth, the choices are yours. A New Galaxy Every Time. Procedural galaxy creation allows as many new experiences as you'd like. When a new game is started, the galaxy map, contents of each sector, and the factions involved will be generated from scratch. You may continue to play this galaxy, or if you'd like to try something different, create a brand new galaxy. Don't worry, your old galaxy will be saved in its current state if you ever wish to return. Choose how many sectors you'd like in your galaxy, as well as how many factions (NPCs) and whether your ships will be Creative or Career mode. Know Your Neighbors. In Kinetic Void the galaxy is a living, breathing thing. Not all factions get along, not all of them hate each other. As factions interact, agreements and treaties will be made and broken. Trade, combat and piracy will affect how the factions see each other based on their own internal standings. Fully Detailed and customizable Space Ships. Tailor your ship for any role. Make a sleek fighter, a bulky freighter, or a mighty carrier. Your ship’s capabilities and appearance are completely up to you. Using Kinetic Void’s ship builder you can make exactly the ship you want. Customize every part of your ship from cockpits, hulls, engines, weapons, and aesthetic modules. Each module has its own statistics that affect the total performance of your ship. Every module can be further customized by adding subsystems (right click on a module to add subsystems). You can even color your ship exactly how you want. Each module has seven color fields allowing you to make amazing ships quickly, and easily. Once your ship is created, save it to your computer, or share it to the Steam Workshop for the world to see. Subscribed ships from the workshop have a random chance of making it into any new galaxy as a faction vessel. Freedom to Choose Your Fate. Be the scourge of the galaxy, or its savior. A life of combat and struggle not your thing? Become an intergalactic trader and influence the galaxy one deal at a time. Not interested in being a ‘good guy’? Take on a life of piracy and plunder your way through sectors, creating havoc wherever you go, then docking at pirate stations for supplies as needed. Intense Active Combat. Target enemy ships and maneuver in real time to align devastating broad-sides or crippling strafing runs. Deploy drones to do your dirty work or simply confuse the enemy into targeting them instead of you while you deal with the enemy vessel. In Kinetic Void, your skills as a pilot are just as important as the components that make up your ship. Take Direct Control Of Your Ship. Kinetic Void offers three control modes. In cursor-mode, the player can control the ship through keyboard commands, and pan the camera with the mouse in any direction for quick tactical overview; or Mouse Flight-mode, allowing direct control of the ship through mouse movements. Control your battleship’s turrets from a sweeping orbital camera or slip between asteroids in a dogfight while piloting your heavy-fighter using mouse flight mode. Switch between modes at any time to best suit the situation.

There has been a long term conflict between the Ettaze and Trettaze states since the time when the Ettaze ruler decided to accept the fact that the human beings had the rights to co-exist with the demons in the Ettaze state where the majority of the state were the demons. This was the kind gesture of the ruler who gave the human beings the equal opportunities to join the universities and have a working career in the state even when some demons had a notion of looking down upon the humans. Under the leadership of Gabbon, the Ettaze ruler, the humans and demons learned to co-exist with each other which the ruler of Trettaze state could never accept. The ruler of the Trettaze state started to attack them in every possible way, banning imports and exports, barring tourists from the state to enter the territory etc. This had led to a war breaking out between the two states. However, Trettaze was the first one to officially declare the war against the Ettaze and threatened to kill all of the humans and the demons of the state. The ruler of the Ettaze had a hunch that a war between the states would break out anytime. He hired the best warriors of the state, the team of the three Demon Girls called Tri-Demon Girls who were said to be the strongest team of warriors in the state, in order to eliminate the intruders at all costs. Meanwhile, Emiko, the granddaughter of the Ettaze ruler, decided to step in at her own will and helped out the Tri-Demon girls team in her own way in order to protect the state against the intruders. Even as a half-demon she had a strong will and determination to achieve something big. Emiko with her own 'Devil Weapon' begins her journey to defeat the enemies, and to become the best warrior in the state and abroad. You play as Emiko and your mission is to fight against the enemies in order to protect the weak. Key Features: 15 Levels to play! Different kinds of enemies including three-headed monster! Lots of deadly traps and obstacles to overcome! 3 Firing modes which include regular, laser and Plasma modes. Ability to freeze the enemies and double jump! Story Driven!

For the safe flight of aircraft, air traffic controllers play a vital role. We focus on the duties of these controllers in our game scenarios. [How to Play] To clear the stages, a player should issue directions as a tower controller for safe and effective flight of aircraft. The operation is quite simple, just select an aircraft and click Instruction buttons. Yet as the situation keeps changing according to the directions issued and the timing, clearing the stage always requires precise and correct judgment. Even after game over, you can resume from the middle of the game replay. [Various Stages Available] Adding to the Game Stage of various play levels, the Extra Stage gives you some special conditions to further liven up the play. You can also select time, wind direction, and section you like for your own Original Stage. [Airport Covered] The game is set in Haneda Airport (HND/RJTT) in Tokyo, which represents Japan!

It is a 2D top-down shooter taking place out in space in a galactic junkyard. In this setting, the players are trying to survive by constructing space ships. The game is round-based and each round is divided up into two phases: build phase and battle phase. During the build phase, each player gets a number of components and has to assemble a spaceship from them within a certain time limit. During the battle phase, the players pilot the ships. They battle against the other or team up against the garbage drones living in the junkyard. The randomness and unpredictable nature of the game makes every round into a new challenge, because you always have a new ship to battle with, raising the stakes and making the game quite addictive. Key Features Creativity under time pressure mixed with action-packed spaceship battles. Deathmatch until only one player remains. A new ship is constructed each round. Scrap King is like Deathmatch but the winner keeps their ship and can continue to build on it. Co-op allows the players to fight together against garbage drones. The players continues to build on their ships after each wave of enemies. Bots fill lasts slots if you are less than 4 people playing. Original soundtrack made by Connor O.R.T. Linning. Numbers 1 to 4 players playing together in local multiplayer. 11 different components to construct spaceships from. 3 different game modes. 3 different deathmatch rule sets. 6 Different maps. 10 Co-op levels. Controls Gamepads are highly recommended for singleplayer and multiplayer. Gamepads tested are Xbox 360 gamepad, Xbox One Gamepad and Steam Controller.

Explore multiple worlds where you must utilise your creative abilities to twist adversity to your advantage. You'll need planning, wits and reflexes to make a way through these ever-changing death labyrinths. Escape flooding passages, outrun toxic pollen, face off against gargantuan bosses that have made entire mazes their home. Do you play defensively with the spear and energy shield, or swing into the fray with a boomerang and grapple hook? Do you scour the levels for potions and runes; or do you dive headfirst into the chaos? Adversity as your ally F.A.Q. Let's be transparent... 'What Gamepads are compatible?” Currently Xbox and Xbox 360 controllers though other Xinput controllers may work. NOTE: Not natively compatible with Playstation controllers yet. Keyboard and mouse works just as well. Is there much of a story in game? There's minimal story exposition as of the current build. We do plan on integrating a loose narrative as development progresses though... “I'm running the game on an old computer, how can I make it run faster?” Please see the following forum thread on optimization : “Where can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?” Please look to the forums, we check messages there each day. Feedback is welcome and there are some excellent community members who are willing to help to. 'Anything else to be aware of?' Default gamepad controls are slightly different from convention, due to optional 360 degree aiming with right analogue stick. Though buttons can be rebound to suit. It’s designed to be challenging, and death may be encountered frequently during your initial runs. Though there is no stunlocking/one-hit demises on the player. Being able to multi-task between abilities will greatly increase survivability. **The game has a steeper learning curve than the average platformer, particularly in the first 25 minutes Every challenge has multiple solutions For example, if there is a chest on the other side of a lava pit; do you...? Grapple across Bend time and bounce off enemies Use a boomerang to fetch the item Blow up the pit with a grenade; setting everything nearby alight! ... More Features Over 80 unique enemies and traps 12+ randomized level themes. Such include tidal corridors filled with mines, rising lava, caverns lined with toxic and carnivorous plants... 4+ Primary world types (grotto, gardens, temple, cold crust caverns) each with their own traps, enemies, boss and special theme layouts. A plethora of creative abilities ranging from parkour to cloaking to warping time itself! Every object has multiple uses E.g. you can grab that lantern from the ceiling, and carry it around to use as a portable light source or improvised flaming molotov... Hand crafted pixel art and animations Regular updates A unique musical score. Customize character skin and clothing colors.

Developer Commentary: Last year I began learning how to program, it was something I had always wanted to do. I used the Twine Interactive Fiction Engine to experiment and learn. I started off with simple tests, which eventually evolved into large games: A train game, where you were stuck on a train and you could shovel coal and drink tea and look out the window at the random scenery selected for that day. It was quite zen. I also created a game based on Edgar Alan Poe's, 'The Raven.' It was an educational game that sought to take a really long poem and dissect it with comics, gifs, and mini-games. People liked it, and I had a fun time dressing up ravens in various costumes for it. Those games were more art than game according to the community. That was a fair opinion, the mechanics were as limited as my knowledge. I wasn't satisfied to just create art though. I wanted to make a game that was unmistakably a game. I set a goal, I was going to make a 100+ level game with maps and mechanics and puzzles. I wasn't going to take a whole decade either, I made an effort to work on it every day, even if I was tired so that I could someday finish it. At first I didn't even know how to make a map. Then I discovered arrays and how to use them. It was magical seeing my character walk around on the map I put together. I spent all day at work coming up with theories as to how I could implement the various features I wanted to put in the game. Errors. Errors. Constant errors. I'd spend all day just trying to get one thing to work. My determination paid off and the mechanics I kept hammering at started to work. Usually at that point they were clunky and flawed. I'd end up completely re-doing them, but I didn't mind, every error was a chance to learn better techniques. I hope that the love put into the game makes it all the more enjoyable to play.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/header.jpg?t=1528811675,https://gamejolt.com/@spess,,superfantasticproductionshelp@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,3,0,,40,0,,0,0,0,0,Midnight Warden,Superfantastic Productions,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Includes level editor","Adventure,Casual,Indie","Casual,Indie,Adventure,Puzzle,Singleplayer,Comedy,Great Soundtrack,2D,Pixel Graphics,Atmospheric","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_0e41758d68b6f583fa6eb8966202bc8a6835c8e5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_1d9bcf28194173e6f9987b109b2c4547be449771.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_98fd49328a45d89bf92ca07368b764349aef7b8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_4235e877773b5cb3d6c1722022a9669f1750d238.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_1a277b6e852163a9103b53f02e1b50520513e62b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_a18331883a214259fa51da60bfbd676b866f8718.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256717973/movie_max.mp4?t=1527607142

1011320,Whiskey & Zombies: The Great Southern Zombie Escape,"Nov 25, 2020",0 - 20000,0,0,9.99,0,"WHISKEY &amp; ZOMBIES is a fun and intense brawler with a fair amount of stealther strategy involved as you need to try and escape a very different zombie apocalypse. Turns out that only whiskey moonshine kills the virus so you need to stay drunk while you brawl, drink, sneak, scavenge, and rage your way through the Deep South. But the more you drink — the harder the game gets. The survival of the human race now rests on the last southern family who knows how to make the whiskey moonshine — the McCrearys — a bunch of permadrunk, bootlegging rednecks who all dislike each other. They must now get home to the Louisiana swampland and their illegal moonshine still — to save humanity. There will be comedy and action mixed together with suspense and nail-biting moments that could easily turn into a screaming, button-mashing frenzy. You can play solo or grab some friends and create some whiskey-fueled zombie-mayhem together in local multiplayer . And if someone turns zombie, all it takes is a bottle of whiskey to bring them back. Features __________________________________________________ Top-Down Mayhem: Swig, slug, swing, and shoot your way through the hordes of undead just waiting to take a bite out of your thinking-noodle. Unique Drunk System: You gotta stay drunk to stay alive but the “safer” you are, the harder the game gets. Too drunk and you can’t shoot for shit and you might even pass out. Not drunk enough and the virus creeps up, impacting your stamina and, of course, might turn you into a zombie. Different Characters &amp; Abilities: Play as one of the 4 McCrearys, each with very different and unique traits. Some are slow and powerful while others are light and fast but can’t hold their whiskey very well. Story-Driven: Discover the McCrearys’ Southern roots and their individual motivations as you help them on their way through the ass-end of Louisiana to their home in the Bayou. Fun but Challenging: It might be easy to sneak around and rack up a few kills, but the more you progress — the more resistance you will meet.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/header.jpg?t=1647272931,http://www.whiskeyandzombies.com,,support@whiskeyandzombies.com,True,True,False,0,,0,8,0,,36,0,,0,0,0,0,Nuttery Entertainment,Nuttery Entertainment,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Remote Play Together","Action,Indie,Strategy","Beat 'em up,Top-Down Shooter,Shoot 'Em Up,Hack and Slash,PvP,Stealth,Fighting,Survival,Strategy,Top-Down,Action,Zombies,Local Co-Op,Singleplayer,Multiplayer,Local Multiplayer,Co-op,4 Player Local,Indie,Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_267825ca0a6963fc3cbf7c1de025fbfc48e09cab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_f30022cd41ec038882489e181838122ba903e5c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_2185a1470dd663807e7442d62e9ac9d44be468fb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_d99580113ce2c3051750fe438c630552b42dcb08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_eb05fc0c56c54473235101b7f4ef4aa94223bfcf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_ac4f719f2cfad4dc4676cb10a966acbb9ebc5416.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_2dd38a718dae95f4af7be1fda7c8426ffb30a2d1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_085b84c31e07933cfbc5f9a785267e5cbaff2364.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_8f65b7dbb4cc97d93c0dbebab4dbebfa3d9a3ef5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_7b26dc268f2827491ceb7c1cb916d13089adcc6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_8c759281a0124a376ff74c9c1e7dcecc2312bf00.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_200277c1dac1556b539422c6d316cba0a613f786.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256877773/movie_max.mp4?t=1647272257,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256804348/movie_max.mp4?t=1647272265"

Each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in. Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters.

Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems.

40420,Tidalis,"Jul 16, 2010",100000 - 200000,0,0,4.99,0,"Tidalis is a block-based puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new 'streams' mechanic. The game is brimming over with riffs and variants on that core mechanic with 20 game modes, dozens of special blocks and items, and 115 levels in the adventure mode alone. The basic rules of the game are this: blocks fall down into the board and have a color and an arrow direction. If a stack of blocks exceeds the height of the board, you lose. In order to clear blocks, you must right-click and drag paths through the arrows to set up chain reactions of like-colored blocks. If this sounds simple, that's because it is -- you'll be lining up lengthy chains within minutes. But you'll be surprised how much brainpower it takes to set up combos of multiple chains, and the many brainteaser-style puzzles include some real stumpers. Tidalis has co-op and competitive multiplayer modes (both online and offline); action-oriented modes and timer-less brainteasers; a lengthy, casual-friendly adventure mode; twenty unique game modes providing innumerable twists to the basic gameplay; dozens of special blocks and items; and over fifty minutes of beautiful music to go with the painterly art. In short, several games' worth of content are built on top of this core mechanic, which you'll quickly find to be as iconic as it is novel. Key Features: Puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new mechanic. Two-player co-op and competitive play (both local and networked). A wide selection of both action-oriented or brainteaser-like levels. Casual-friendly adventure mode, hardcore-focused custom games and vs modes. 20+ game styles, and dozens of items and special blocks. Rich, painterly art style and beautiful music. Players can create and share whole new themes, levels, and adventures. Options for colorblind players, players averse to lots of light and motion, and older computers.",['English'],[],"'Tidalis is a match-3 game that doesn't feel tired or repetitive: I actually want to play it, which says something considering how many puzzle games I've reviewed.

Yes the gameplay is casual but this is a highly developed, well-rounded, offering from Arcen Games that puts many games of higher price to shame. It's got numerous ways to play and very successfully takes an old genre, turns it on its head, and shows you just what can be done when you think outside of the box.'

We wanted to create a short visceral, realistic experience stripped of user interface, lobbies, scores, levels, and other visual intrusions that might distract. There were some key elements of fighting a dragon that we wanted to capture and we felt VR was uniquely qualified to convey: Face to face with a large scale hostile creature trying to kill you Using a sword and a shield Fire! Nowhere to run! This started out as an internal experiment to learn some things about VR’s capabilities, be reductionist in our designs, etc. We felt that the experiment was successful enough to release as a free experience to share.

283620,World of Subways 3 – London Underground Circle Line,"May 12, 2014",100000 - 200000,0,0,14.99,0,"World of Subways' is our series of the most interesting Subway and Underground routes of the world for the PC. After the releases of New York and Berlin we are now proud to introduce Vol.3 - London Underground. This simulation covers the entire Circle Line in its current operational service which includes the new section to Hammersmith. This line offers a length of 27km with 35 stations, many hours of fun and interesting missions The Circle Line is an underground service of the London Underground circling the center of London. It was first described as such in 1949 and already appeared on the 1947 Underground Map. It had not been built as a separate line, but was merged from different sections of the Metropolitan Line and the District Line. Only two short sections of this line are solely used by the Circle line. These sections are the connecting curves between the stations of High Street Kensington and Gloucester Road and between Aldgate and Tower Hill. Features 3D - Cockpit with rotatable camera Original virtual reproductions of 35 stations on the Circle Line Free movement in the train and at the stations (accomplished for the first time ever!) More realistic AI trains, dynamic passengers on the platforms Superb graphics, reflecting headlights, night effects Realistic announcements recorded exclusively by the original speaker Tube map Physics The physics have been developed based on real values, such as those used in training simulators. The driving and braking characteristics of the trains are reproduced faithfully and reflect the feeling to actually controlling a train of the London Underground. Graphics Compared to the first two products in this series, Vol. 3 uses a new 3D engine. The simulator is now based on the Vision Engine Trinigy, which made it possible to substantially improve lighting and 3D effects. At the same time the stability and performance of the 3D engine has been improved.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],"“World of Subways - Volume 3 hebt sich deutlich von seiner Konkurrenz ab und führt derzeit die Simulationen an.” 85% – -subways-3-test-alles-einsteigen-wir-fahren-durch-london.html “World of Subways is a lovingly realistic recreation of the Circle Line of the London Underground, with the amount of detail that has gone into both the stations, and the trains, it sets the bar of train simulators, and is definitely one for the true hardcore sim crowd.

391280,Epic Manager - Create Your Own Adventuring Agency!,"Dec 12, 2016",50000 - 100000,0,0,17.99,1,"You are the General Manager and CEO of your very own Adventuring Agency, the riskiest yet most lucrative business in the Realm of Astraeus. Recruit adventurers, negotiate their contracts, send them out on dangerous quests and reap the rewards should they make it out alive. Expand your Agency, manage your growing resources and best your competitors to become the Epic Manager! Epic Manager is a fresh new take on the Tycoon RPG genre, heavily inspired by classics we all know and love! The game presents a unique mix of roster management and character progression found in titles like Football Manager or Final Fantasy Tactics , narrative choices &amp; consequences in the beloved tradition of gamebooks series Choose Your Own Adventure , the epic scope of a D&amp;D campaign or a Lord of the Rings novel and the humoristic tone of The Princess Bride , all in one awesome package! Your goal is to gain the title of Epic Manager by becoming the most famous Adventuring Agency in the vast Realm of Astraeus. Send agents on the field to prospect new job opportunities, scout the dangers ahead, recruit new adventurers, negotiate their contracts, organize them in parties and complete dangerous quests to earn more fame than your rivals and climb the rankings of the League Ladder! Along with managing your contracts and jobs, you’ll also hire support staff, trade with the local merchants, upgrade your agency’s HQ, research new abilities and upgrades, expand your reach across Astraeus and interact with competitors by using intrigue and diplomatic actions. Adventurers are the backbone of your Agency. To find them, you’ll first need to organize recruitment campaigns across the Realm, then negotiate contract terms with those who present suitable talents, traits and growth potential! Add recruits to your ever-growing roster of unique characters and manage their progression as they gain experience and level-up. Experiment with the endless combinations and powerful synergies offered by our Multi Class system and build parties suited for every situation. Discover an emergent narrative shaped by YOUR actions. As your forces move on the map, they will come across an ever-growing bank of Random Encounters, narrative mini-scenarios giving you many choices on how to proceed. In some cases, having a specific class in your party will even reveal special hints and hidden options! In each campaign, actions you make will influence the ruthless political web of Astraeus and modify your reputation with each of the game’s 12 factions. Encounters and quests you decide to complete will lead to job opportunities that might not have available to you otherwise. As your agency grows, you’ll also use the Tech Tree and spend research points to unlock new abilities and specializations that fit your own play-style. As the commander-in-chief, you’ll get to take command of your adventurers as they meet increasingly dangerous foes on the battlefield. The parties you create will allow for powerful class and character synergies to stack the odds in your favor, as you make the best use of the hundreds of items, skills and spells at your disposal. Scout battles in advance to gather intelligence about the enemy forces and better exploit the weaknesses of dozens of enemy types inspired by bestiary classics : Goblins, Orcs, Ratmen, Gnolls, Skeletons, Zombies, Giants and many more! Some adventurers will grow from rookies to heroes, legends even, while others will quickly meet an untimely end. Such are the dangers of being an adventurer! Epic Manager features many procedurally generated content like randomized adventurers, equipment items and quest rewards to make each play-through different from the next! We want Astraeus to feel like a living world that reacts to you, just as you react to it. World Events, Random Encounters and RNG-based dice rolls will determine the consequences of some of your choices, changing the priorities of your Agency’s day-to-day operations. Scattered in Astraeus are very familiar and powerful characters. Some, like the Shovel Knight and Rogue Legacy Knight might be easy to find, others not so much - look for them as your forces venture across the Realm! Dozens of Enemy Types and tons of Quests, Random Encounters and World Events. Unique characters and bosses. Trade Adventurers with other agencies. Discover all hidden “Prestige Classes”, available for High-Level characters. New Merchant : Enchant and improve equipment at the Enchanter. New Merchant : Craft and combine items by visiting the Alchemist. Community-Created Content :Adventurers, Quests, Encounters, Items and more!

471770,"In Case of Emergency, Release Raptor","Aug 29, 2016",20000 - 50000,0,0,0.0,0,"NOTE: This game is very unfinished and is free for you to enjoy because we thought what is there was fun and worth you being able to tinker with. We make no claim that this is a complete experience. It was a passion project for Chris, and a lot of time was poured into this, and we wanted to let you faff about with it. If you leave a review, then reviewing it based on what it actually is (a freebie tech demo) is appreciated. Be a raptor, feel like one, and smash robots to bits. Procedurally-assembled 3D environments set in a scenic futuristic dystopia. Free release of an aborted Early Access title. We hope you enjoy it! Note that this is an AS-IS release, based on popular demand, rather than us taking it down completely. Sell Me The Idea In One Sentence If I have to convince you why being any form of dromaeosaurid is freaking awesome, then I'm not sure we can be friends. This game is carefully crafted to give you the closest possible feeling of being one of these glorious monsters -- then turning you loose to do fun stuff. What’s The Point? 1. For the pure fun of the thing. In 1993, a certain game let you be a raptor. The controls were iffy. The levels were short and static. It's very dated. Yet many of us still dust it off periodically -- just to be a raptor. Release Raptor gives you a far more satisfying, modern, dynamic experience. 2. For a power trip. For speedrunning and finesse, you're on an invincible rampage. It's not about IF you can do it, but how WELL you do it. Your performance is evaluated, so mistakes still have consequences without interrupting the flow of the game. 3. To play with kids. I want to be able to play this with my 5 year old son, but still have dismemberment (because that's cool). How to do that without blood or gore? Robots! Little robots = pouncing targets; giant mechs = dismemberment targets. Procedural Assembly What on earth do we mean by 'procedurally-assembled?' Basically, we're using a very heavy mix of handcrafted content with procedural bits making it fresh each time. Creating unique and recognizable areas is a huge focus, because otherwise you get unimaginative 'procgen blandness.' Yuck! But we still wanted that sense of exploration, and so not chunk of level is present in every run, the layouts of the overall level (and where enemies are as well) varies quite a bit. NB: Yes, we know that’s not a velociraptor (and there should be feathers).",['English'],['English'],"“This is so cool.” AaronSayWhat “Being a raptor and doing raptor stuff, always a good time.” DemoStorm “I wish I could have finished making this, but instead you can have it for free.” Chris Park (Arcen dev)",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/header.jpg?t=1586552189,http://arcengames.com/in-case-of-emergency-release-raptor/,"https://www.arcengames.com/forums/index.php/board,120.0.html",,True,True,True,0,,0,50,18,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,"Arcen Games, LLC","Arcen Games, LLC","Single-player,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Action,Adventure,Indie","Action,Indie,Adventure,Dinosaurs,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_8391ae4084299a3506e26f57d1a1799cf266e149.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_ce1be30904fae9a7f620104ae74b0bc95760d55b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_d9220b46791f15a140a0189c805ced44be399005.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_1fe3c05f43ccfe9dd4d663cdc5e4d7e8abeaa026.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_cd7a55537b646ee66caae00341b6ce4dc4854d52.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_23ebb63f9f88fb712c8888c269b3c3e9d8956437.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_c9e306100e143ac190a38b1a27283a9abedcb95e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_04a66bb7aabdd569b9c3b1888a67288eeb3f5d21.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_e0930921ce3936bebc3dd75976823d8eba5a8551.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_584eb9bacbf4046a37eaeca8fd707d3ddcfa1f9b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_ac5ad620d4e6842064cc6789ece5edc8f15f73bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_a16501e46e9163fba9bc65144bf9c97b15720f35.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_7280f45fb9b6d16b9645f29c4d9e1b455b128cdd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_12bff1b13b9dc4de77c8f3f6918a91b80cb6e7ec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_87d1eaf76389a2f75f84e3f5ba222ebe38e65ca2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256669489/movie_max.mp4?t=1472063621,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256665679/movie_max.mp4?t=1465952402,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256664108/movie_max.mp4?t=1463077343"

Hunt him through more than 100 rooms with a variety of fun weapons, challenging bosses, and adorable pixel graphics!

They may not have been as slick or polished as modern games, but their charm lives on! Features: Explore more than 100+ huge rooms/levels. Discover 6 weapons and 3 abilities to defeat your enemies. Battle 5 heinous bosses. Stay in control with gamepad support. Learn tips, tricks, and more with the fully illustrated instruction manual. Play as tiny pixel apes — armed with guns! *Please note that I developed this game for the keyboard and Xbox controller, and the messages you see during the game will reflect this!

312540,Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim,"Apr 28, 2015",100000 - 200000,5,0,19.99,1,"Red-haired adventurer extraordinaire Adol Christin has finally reunited with his best pal, Dogi, and is eager to set sail for new adventures in Afroca. It seems fate has other plans for him, however, as a pirate captain named Ladoc makes him an offer he simply can't refuse: a chance to explore a dangerous, uncharted archipelago in the Atlas Ocean that may hold treasures of heretofore unseen value. Never ones to back away from a good mystery, Adol and Dogi both agree to join Ladoc on this expedition aboard his ship, the “Tres Mares” -- but no sooner does it weigh anchor than the Romuns, their sights set on the same curious islands of Canaan, attack the wayward pirates and ultimately knock Adol overboard, leaving him for dead. Some time later, he washes ashore in Canaan itself, alive but weakened, rescued and resuscitated by two young girls named Isha and Olha who sport long ears and bushy tails. They are of the native “Rehda” tribe, and it seems Adol is not the first human to arrive here -- nor are humans particularly welcome... Come experience the very first 3D Ys game as you've never experienced it before! Already the foundation upon which Ys: The Oath in Felghana and Ys Origin would later be built, this version of Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim comes equipped with an original translation and brand new, entirely unique gameplay features such as the addition of a super hardcore “Catastrophe Mode” for fans of the later titles, full widescreen support, map warping, Steam achievements and leaderboards, and even a full digital art book packed with concept sketches, hi-res character portraits and original production PSDs. See what you've been missing with this definitive version of the game that brought Ys into the modern era!

Immerse yourself in the ambient atmosphere and otherworldly music for a soothing experience. Search for lost artifacts hidden throughout the world in order to unlock the final secret of Mare. REVIEWS Upload VR: Winner of 2021 Upload Awards - Hidden Gem. Mare is a breathless beauty of a VR game – simplistic in its progression perhaps but never anything less than astonishing to take in. The VR Grid: It’s not about the destination, but the journey as they say, and Mare is one helluva journey. From the opening moments of the game, all the way to it’s conclusion, I was enamored by the presentation and the story. Mare is nothing short of breathtaking and a welcome change of pace to the to action-packed, fast-paced titles I have been playing of late. Its a strikingly beautiful yet solemn adventure that pushes you ever forward toward the unknown. 6DOF Reviews: Mare is a title I can easily recommend to anybody who has an appreciation for beauty and mystery. It evokes a mood unlike any I’ve experienced in VR.. It may be brief, but its impact will far outlive its duration, proving beyond a doubt that it’s the quality of our experiences that matter, and not their duration. Mare is a class act from start to finish. It's a macabre and mysterious adventure that offers a haunting experience that long outlives its light puzzles and relatively brief playtime. VR Focus: A puzzle experience with beautiful scenery and a mysterious plotline all about a girl who needs your help. The barren environment coupled with the superb musical score ensures Mare has an ambience and soul few VR projects achieve.","['English', 'French', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'German']",[],“A Breathless Beauty Of A VR Game” 4/5 – Upload VR “Mare is a class act from start to finish.

45750,Lost Planet® 2,"Oct 15, 2010",200000 - 500000,10,0,0.0,0,"The larger than life action of Lost Planet 2 , comes to PC! Lost Planet 2 is the sequel to Lost Planet™: Extreme Condition, the landmark third-person shooter which debuted on Xbox 360 and went on to sell over 2.3 million units worldwide after its release. Lost Planet 2 offers deeper insight into the world of E.D.N III and the uncertain fate of future mankind. Already acclaimed for its visual accomplishments from the console versions, Lost Planet 2 will define the 3D experience on the PC. Stunning environments will immerse the player in NVIDIA Vision Surround technology, and the rebalanced gameplay and streamlined control mechanics make Lost Planet 2 PC the ultimate Lost Planet experience. A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Mankind has engaged in a civil war to take control of the precious Thermal Energy that powers weapons and vehicles on E.D.N. III and resulted in a separation into various factions. Players will control heroes from each faction across 6 interconnected episodes, viewing the war from the perspective of each, creating a truly unique interactive experience. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players’ perspectives. The intense and action-packed campaign mode comes with the ability to form teams of up to 4 players online. Beyond the deep single-player and co-op modes, Lost Planet 2 is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes allowing up to 16 players to compete online, each with their own customizable avatar. No action game would be complete without an arsenal of weaponry, and Lost Planet 2 has a huge variety of hardware for players to unleash on unsuspecting enemies. Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. The grappling hooks that made the gameplay in Lost Planet a true 3-D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by moving to elevated locations quickly. Lost Planet 2’s biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are VS that transform into other vehicles, hold up to three players and some that even take multiple players to operate. Key Features: Co-op action: Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4 player online co-operative play. Teamwork is the player’s key to victory as the team is dependent on each other to succeed and survive. Massive scale of enemies: Players skill on the battlefield and ability to work as a team will be tested like never before against the giant Akrid. Players will utilize teamwork tactics, new weapons and a variety of vital suits (VS) to fight these larger-than-life bosses. Beautiful massive environments: Capcom’s advanced graphics engine, MT Framework 2.0, and DirectX 11 support will bring the game to life with the next step in 3D fidelity and performance. See Lost Planet 2’s world through new eyes, with support for hardware tessellation and compute shader. Deep level of character customization: Players will have hundreds of different ways to customize their look, nom de guerre, emotes, and weapons to truly help them define their character on the battlefield. A wide array of customizable abilities range from taking less damage, to running faster to operating data posts quicker Rewards System: Players will receive rewards for assisting teammates and contributing to the team’s success Multiplayer: Compete in 16-player multiplayer matches with nine different maps and 5 different game modes including Data Post Battle, Akrid Egg Battle, Fugitive, Elimination and Team Elimination. Additional maps will be available as downloadable content after the game’s release. Exciting new VS features: Based on fan feedback, the team has implemented an unbelievable variety of Vital Suits and new ways to combat VS’s. The new VS system will have a powerful impact on the way the player takes to the war zone in Lost Planet 2.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Russian']","['English', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/header.jpg?t=1636428326,http://www.lostplanetcommunity.com/,http://www.capcom.co.jp/support/contact/,,True,False,False,63,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/lost-planet-2?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,1640,794,,0,2021,,593,0,427,0,"CAPCOM CO., LTD.",Capcom,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure","Action,Co-op,Adventure,Third-Person Shooter,Mechs,Sci-fi,Multiplayer,Third Person,Online Co-Op,Cult Classic,Shooter,Character Customization,Singleplayer,Aliens,Co-op Campaign","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_31ebe9ef0638b7070cde8874f17bd54949e1573d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_12826d07abfe140d530e5b9dff2af5c7c5946bf7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_6f91dc8ceb4181fb55b7f63cabbdf0de4a19a47c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_327e60c0a5b3a90b59d17bf41071bda2271d45d1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_f87b3a62788c70f60444c6d5f1c476903851fdeb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_c4b411eab2ad2146049811a6e223f934d1bd8ec7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_e2784bc6807d227f49b02ec6bc5e20cbc2149a1a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_926d4ce526c059ceb5228a46b0de42ae110ae3b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_2dc17aa52d3d4d1c5b7169f97fc4c8be13d64c74.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_ee2b6f75957ccda7bdbfaeeb66081f1b670e28be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_6634015ce26af3c9e377d6c67a78a376dfcd5f34.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_424e2abc2ca387e79347b71b11184aa0ed0579ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_88901375a1975c634b361b4ead50a769d17597f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_ce71290a2e7784eea4f5f802a08c9e883f44a5c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326",

1715970,ZEE.END,"Sep 14, 2021",0 - 20000,0,0,13.99,0,"During the arms race, the government of a small country, in the absence of large budgets, decides to go the other way. Fearing for his sovereignty, contacts a secret corporation for the development of biological weapons of mass destruction, with name - Zero Experimental Establishment or ZEE. The project is allocated funds and a place of development - a remote corner of the country - the Montib island, cut off from the world, with a small population and no modern infrastructure. The deafening success of experiments is comparable only with the fundamental failure of the all development. The next monthly report says about the fall of a helicopter with samples of biological weapons on the island. And a week later, after reports of the observation - of infection of local residents, communication with the employees of the corporation, and indeed with anyone in general, disappears. The government makes a decision in secret from the world community and, despite the protests of the residents of the country who have relatives there, cut off the entire Montib island from the external world, and under pressure forces ZEE to investigate what happened. Despite the military patrolling the sea around the island and the likelihood of dying from the virus, the flow of people trying to get there is not running out. Someone wants to find relatives and friends, help residents, and someone wants to take possession of the abandoned property of a corporation or just have fun in a place where the laws no longer work. Why are you there - you decide. The release version of the game will include: - We have a huge map 20 by 20 kilometers, to reach the other end you need at least an hour and a half, with villages, cities and military bases - The map contains areas of summer, autumn and winter, with different air temperatures - Spawn is located along the entire southern coast (no respawns in the center of the map near military bases with top loot!) - Two factions. Marauders and Hunters (players will be divided into two factions, depending on their actions. Marauders will be those who kill players, Hunters - who kill bots and marauders. Each faction will have its own camp with a store) - Extraction of resources, from the simplest tree to valuable gold (gold will be a currency that can be exchanged for some things) - Transport with physics close to real, with repairs and refueling (one or two helicopters per server, which will not be easy to assemble) - Crafting and cooking (such dishes as ukha or mushroom soup will give an hourly buff of one or another characteristic, so cooking makes sense) - Building bases (wood - stone - metal) - Missions (missions will appear on the map, simulating various situations)",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/header.jpg?t=1641121578,https://vk.com/zee_end,https://vk.com/zee_end,zeeend@vk.com,True,False,False,0,,0,14,21,,0,0,Contains scenes of violence and cruelty and blood,0,0,0,0,T.LEE,T.LEE,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,LAN PvP","Action,Adventure,RPG,Simulation,Early Access","Action,Survival,Open World,Zombies,RPG,PvP,Multiplayer,Shooter,Looter Shooter,PvE,Base-Building,Exploration,First-Person,Singleplayer,Third Person,Atmospheric,Driving,Adventure,Character Customization,Early Access","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_9afd0aa78f9b38b055b10ca03e484a742552ae5c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_552db9fb0a931736fef24dc071516fd777b4c4b7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_157b03d0d14da78c3328fa64d2744f4082580d29.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_d4dc4bbd3bcb822906f451461d6601b9e7a671df.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_07f599617ef60d161fa6dad665b85cbe963bcb8c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_807888e769c983f29625257f0e97ccb497f8d9dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_84390897d00c38e52f90f579ef25ea51cf518024.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_aba42710bba1617e6c7e795f7e17606fb04483ab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_f4a14e6e0f58b6095b593a14cffe6ed392850f7b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_2b430f088eeb6b7f6fa381a8a89b1631454dd649.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_b161f98a94efba392223e759beeedcaef309f326.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_eebe61ed136f3bf3396763b14b35261ae4fa9fa6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_66b1c2268c788a6f891b489830a72cd76c4d4809.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_30d3be8329690976a06e7f768874d64f2f080881.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_ad2d0169bf187ef36bee24160b5100cadb0ea05f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_6a1a6d381e0f884b2f99a982c52566e8dba9d9da.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_8ed31bd6caa8b8cc7c3c71b6d8198b229ee9cdc9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_d96d222af4def3d0793710ad82261e4cd63bc3b3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_82c28faa015692bc73130aec0c2fc6497805584c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_14ae0352de75b5d23ef807ef2870ba9e4fcc1be2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_ea970a0761dccace23a98d7f2be90aac454261d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_579e1cf01b991a524fcc40a7ec7543f9f399d29b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_dba6f90fbceaadb6c17fbb51d85482ee047f8cb0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_9d4950216375d822e6e8a0699545e0cc257a430c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_bea2105452eb7ffaf27cafbb13dd932d784f7c52.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_c55fa0dcd07d1e1eb8a788387b74d9dd3399b3d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_8df38323ed1d6e6200fa1061b33ed1aac41c6080.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_c8221fa5de4c40544d669576aa21e37976c28658.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256845918/movie_max.mp4?t=1632461080,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256854236/movie_max.mp4?t=1633170362"

Here, time passes slowly like a huge wave; people and nature exist together in eternal harmony and prosperity. Beings living here discovered a miraculous power, which was, at first, small, and then grew large enough to move the world. The power transformed into 'mana,' a force that could only be handled by a chosen few, to whom it was entrusted. It has been used properly and passed down from generation to generation; now, after several millennia, the power has become common and natural, a convenient form of witchcraft. However, some things have been forgotten over the long period of peace. An immense and dangerous power. The temptation of the dark side that even sees destruction as worthwhile, depending on how the power is used. Behind the convenient, gentle witchcraft used by all, is this dark temptation that has never disappeared. People also forgot that this immense power is vital for maintaining the existence of the world. Eventually, it changed into a special witchcraft; only a few talented and gifted people can handle it. This is a story about young witches who use this special magic as it was meant to be used.","['English', 'Japanese']",['Japanese'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/header.jpg?t=1582683291,http://studio-siesta.mails.ne.jp/two/web-en/index.html,http://rocket-engine.co.jp/,info@rocket-engine.co.jp,True,False,False,0,,0,160,12,,44,166,,0,0,0,0,Studio SiestA,"Rocket-Engine Co.,Ltd.","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Indie","Action,Indie,Shoot 'Em Up,Anime,Bullet Hell,Female Protagonist,Cute,Arcade,2D","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_c35ceb93ec471674183239626524be6ae290f585.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_04ddadda08325a79fdd2d2a528469896dc86b18e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_06a9e3a60deee3469147c96543434a521a75f20b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_43da6887d7e3a542acaba00bdfcab9453f033076.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_5bd87725b82b3e6ee376b6e35573d7636888a678.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_e5f14dc746088e7c837f8bf953bead3ac4ae3aa2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_eee0f61dafb9a5bf2951a26d7e5f5e9866b624f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_4482b1028cbbb9766d5a694b5c58678c7a018953.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_39f42ad3424d3a03875806e80c705fd2db8c2778.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_20fd5be0c53a7cabec24ed08680c9dff67b54613.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_015324a07761f313dc8696015204e04fa27d254c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_010cb88b9548806aafe0588d6fe1c92450612bf0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_4a3dc0ad3f14df6f8c73872d3cec795b38eb73ab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_bbe48ef2c0b094fce5b2093512f69bc921836d95.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_869b594cd164efa605c54b6d1fc73fa58fd34870.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_d13b5b13f574e794f22936b026de88269e766a9a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_c7588a8bafe3b31d42ecc0563fd2d886f53eb3a8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_c4e9950b522ee572be71ff28be61f409b03af503.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_5bc8f25ff0a8aa6d56db101791e406d8eb932a0d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/460630/ss_c9edb8cef913b3435389e25619ff5d2b0a0117b9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1582683291","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256667492/movie_max.mp4?t=1469413993,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256667493/movie_max.mp4?t=1469414004,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256667494/movie_max.mp4?t=1469414016,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256667495/movie_max.mp4?t=1469414027,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256667496/movie_max.mp4?t=1469414037,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256665353/movie_max.mp4?t=1465468538,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256665354/movie_max.mp4?t=1465468546,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256665355/movie_max.mp4?t=1465468556,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256663411/movie_max.mp4?t=1461816861"

380990,B.A.D Battle Armor Division,"Aug 18, 2015",0 - 20000,0,0,5.99,0,"B.A.D is an intense and enjoyable Shoote'em up game that captures the feeling of controlling a mass-produced humanoid robot (Battle Armor) piloted by a single soldier while keeping the realistic fast-paced action in a dramatic large scale conflict, from various Factions of Earth and Mars. More than 200 years had passed since colonization on Mars had begun. A slow process of terraformation had begun, occurring in the atmosphere and modifying its chemical composition. Despite the rarefied air and radiation, millions of people inhabited the planet. Mars was exploited for its mineral resources, but it served above all to reach the moons of Jupiter. In 2437, a new mineral called Ixenio was discovered on those moons. Ixenio was known to be indestructible over time, the hardest of hardest metals and able to generate an incredible quantity of energy through exposure to photon beams... it was the new black gold. In 2512, Mars was aware that it had become a superpower and it took advantage of the conflict between the Euro America League and the Asiatic Union to form and declare the Independent Martian Kingdom, I.M.K. The Asiatic Union sided with the I.M.K. while the Euro American League still claimed its own rights. All out war was, by then, at the door... The I.M.K. suddenly attacked Moon Base, using the asteroid fortress Abraxis as its logistic base. It conquered Moon Base and exploited it to send troops on Earth in support of the Asiatic Union. It was the beginning of Interplanetary War I. Key Features: Action Shooter with a tactical approach. 360 degree shooting system. More than 16 level: fight on earth and in space.

251990,Long Live The Queen,"Nov 8, 2013",200000 - 500000,17,0,9.99,0,"Rule the world or die trying! Being a Princess is not an easy job. Being a Queen is even harder. Especially when you're only fourteen years old, and the reason you've inherited the throne is that your royal mother has just met an untimely end. Now power is up for grabs. You may be the official heir, but much of the country's nobility would love to steal the throne for themselves. Aggressive neighbors will take advantage of any weakness to enlarge their borders at your expense. And that's not even mentioning the magical dangers which are lying in wait... Can you survive long enough to reach your coronation? THE QUEEN IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE QUEEN",['English'],[],"“Each time the protagonist dies, you find yourself coming back with a vengeance, determined to try a new strategy, a different approach to her upbringing. It's borderline addictive. It's also likely to make a monster out of you. By the end of my first successful playthrough, I had summarily butchered everyone who even thought about looking at us funny, forced the princess into a continuous state of docility and lied my way through every social encounter possible. Was it evil? Yes. Was it glorious? Definitely.” “Somehow it never occurred to my princess, whom I’d lovingly crafted into a tense, paranoid warlord, that she shouldn’t empty a box of mysterious mailcandy into her mouth. You would think studying poison and espionage would have saved me from this espionage poison, but instead, a list of other skills, skills I never studied, princess skills, were key to avoiding this fate. I guess that’s the lesson: you can’t build a successful Arya without adding a little Sansa.” PCGamer “If you’re the sort who can sink your teeth into a full afternoon of tabletop strategy, you’ll be happy here. Long Live The Queen is a slow-paced, cozy evening kind of game, good for folks who like numbers and critical thinking. And death.

1342790,GangV | VR & PC Battle Royale,"Apr 16, 2021",20000 - 50000,2,0,10.49,0,"GangV is a Battle Royale taking place in a living environment featuring traffic, crowds, and law enforcement! Why is this a big deal? Because it changes everything! More Than Your Regular Shooter You start with your own vehicle on a wild starting block with your online opponents and you must be the last one to survive. GangV has a strong emphasis on high-speed chases in the middle of the traffic featuring many different cars but also planes, boats, and helicopters! The game will require your shooter skills as well as your pilot skills for you to be victorious! But be careful, you start with just a gun and your own car may be quickly spotted by your opponents! Steal Your Loot You’ll have to Steal money and equipment from civilians that will call law enforcement on you. The businesses you rob will not only bring you money but also become part of your gang’s territory. This turf war has a huge impact on the Battle Royale as it allows you to put pressure on your rivals, especially at the end of the game as businesses allow you to buy medicine and ammunition. Fight and Run Away From Law Enforcement Depending on your previous actions (heists, murders, …), you’ll have to fight policemen, SWAT, or militaries but you can’t keep on the fight against them forever, you will have to run away and hide from them to focus again on killing your opponents. Hide In the Crowd There is nothing differentiating you from a civilian. That means you can hide in the crowd and in the traffic to find and take your opponents by surprise. But be careful as any civilian could also be a player hiding! Seasons GangV is an evolving world, each season offers content updates and a unique game mode to let you experience a new way to play in this huge living world. Free-Roaming If you want to take a break between matches, feel free to experience our online free-roaming game mode to have fun online with friends in the game’s world of freedom. VR Compatibility GangV is fully compatible with Virtual Reality devices for seated or room-scale VR sessions. Live the ultimate living world Battle Royale experience in VR! Dynamic Modding (Coming Soon) The game supports many modding possibilities, from model reskinning, map creation, content adding to full game mode creation. Our Dynamic Modding option will allow you to share your modded content with other players in real-time on fully dynamic modding servers.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Arabic', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Portuguese', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Czech', 'Polish', 'Romanian', 'Turkish']","['English', 'Turkish']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342790/header.jpg?t=1637075516,https://discord.gg/eukvRRn,https://discord.gg/kXvGwr3,team@raptor-lab.com,True,False,False,0,,0,321,154,,0,296,This game features extreme acts of violence and criminality.,0,0,0,0,raptor lab,raptor lab,"Multi-player,MMO,PvP,Online PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op","Action,Massively Multiplayer,Early Access","Early Access,Battle Royale,Open World,Multiplayer,Shooter,PvP,Action,Co-op,Online Co-Op,FPS,Third-Person Shooter,Violent,Third Person,First-Person,Crime,Massively Multiplayer,Heist,Racing,Realistic,Driving","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342790/ss_3ab3700e1083d870a12a0fa95ab1c165ac7ff09c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637075516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342790/ss_9d08cc255fa1f123240999c450c7f0b06bb912ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637075516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342790/ss_af5683375ab7414989bbe83cf6119407ccd430da.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637075516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342790/ss_0e5189b77fc9ed79192c0ef0b1b935323ad377e6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637075516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342790/ss_aede4a30e22bc3f5c55a016d2a3e8bcd0833b024.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637075516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342790/ss_1b1038b4cbe8b4643c6789564c43b768980db96a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637075516","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256825073/movie_max.mp4?t=1618607557,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256825077/movie_max.mp4?t=1615312819,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256825140/movie_max.mp4?t=1615287841"

1207390,Ghosts'n DJs,"Feb 6, 2020",0 - 20000,0,0,0.0,0,"In a parallel universe where a life is in a 16-bit pixelated form, the music scene has been dominated by fake artists and DJ’s. They rise to fame and become superstars in the media because of two important tools. The first are ghost producers they hire to make music for them so they can release it under their names. The second is a dangerous power brought from the Pit of Averno. This mystical evil power is called MONEY. These evil creatures are known as Devil Goata, Paul Douchebag, Paris Sheraton, Steve Karaoki and Pete Bullshit. Their goal is to destroy the love for the music in this universe by making all of it to sound the same and stupid, using a terrifying and malicious artifact known as THE TEMPLATE. There is still chance for real music to survive. Help Dr. Kucho! on his crusade for the love of music. Fight the fake and avoid cheesy music to poison the weak minds. Find the template and destroy it so ghost producers won't be able to make music for anyone and fake artists will be forced to live by their own merits… if they can. It’s time to send these creatures back to the 16-bit hell they came from using musical supports as weapons. Ghosts‘n DJ’s is a project born from the love of music and it’s a tribute to the arcade games of the 80’s and 90’s. No ghost programmers were used in the making of this video game. Ghosts'n DJs is fully created and starred by Dr. Kucho! , one of the most industrious and long-standing producers and DJs ever after almost three decades in the industry, with a portfolio of more than 300 house music releases, including his latest hit “Can't Stop Playing”. The game proudly features deadmau5 , the groundbreaking electronic artist who has changed pop culture as we know it with albums such “4 × 4 = 12”, “For Lack Of A Better Name” and “Random Album Title”. He’s also critically acclaimed for his singles 'Sofi Needs A Ladder', 'Ghosts 'n' Stuff' and 'I Remember”. deadmau5 kindly allowed the use of his tracks “Polaris”, “4Ware', “GG” and 'Three pound chicken wing' to be part of the soundtrack of this game. Features Satirical pixel-art run and gun side-scrolling action platformer. Inspired by the classic arcade hit Ghosts'n Goblins. Set in a parallel universe in which the music scene is being dominated by fake DJ’s. 3 stages, 5 different enemies, walking and flying enemy behaviors, and one final boss. 4 regular weapons + deadmau5 head as armor and super weapon. 4 levels of difficulty for beginners and ultra hard core players. Super fast and fluid action gameplay. CRT filter for arcade feel. FX sounds based on 8 bit YM2203 and MOS6581 sound chips. Fully created by the house music legend Dr. Kucho! Featuring deadmau5.",['English'],['English'],"“In Ghosts’n DJs you can see Kucho’s devotion for the classic Ghosts'n Goblins.” IGN “You’ll have to run, jump, and climb your way across each level.” Siliconera “It is fun to play, feels a lot like it’s GnG inspiration and does make you smile – especially when you see some of the DJs combat moves.” Alpha Beta Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1207390/header.jpg?t=1581019279,http://www.drkuchogames.com,http://www.drkuchogames.com,support@drkuchogames.com,True,True,False,0,,0,111,15,,14,0,,0,0,0,0,Dr. Kucho!

You’ll set up things like houses and tools, without using hardly any words, just like a simulation game.

Some people might even see the word in English and scream “Ahhhh! English!!! Run awaaay!!” In that case, why not think of it as “playing with building blocks (programing)” instead? The block structure you make runs as software. The only resource you need is this application. I’ll say it once more. “Programs are toys.” Now’s your chance to assemble some toys. This isn’t simply a program (toy). This isn’t simply a game. Through this toy (game), you can develop software. Once you’ve developed something, you can use the attached CARPEXECUTABLE.exe (HANDMADE CARPEXECUTABLE) (It is in the [C:\Program Files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\HANDMADE CARPROGRAM\CARPROGRAM] folder) to execute your creation, and even distribute it to others.

The lingering remains of a demon society hide a twisted maze and the history that its inhabitants left behind. Uncovering a wealth of Shadowlands theology and the frightening creatures that have since overtaken the premises, Rina begins to better understand her circumstances. But as the stakes are risen and new challenges are presented, how will the motivations of those around her change? 'The Dream of Shadowlands' is a top-down RPG series inspired by the RPGMaker horror niche. It features art assets that were drawn traditionally with ink and paper, and a retro style based on 90's anime.

A service robot named J5T-1N has arrived in your dimension to warn of impending doom from an overwhelming force known as the Imperium. Fight for survival across a procedurally generated and emergent mission-based campaign through reactive, tactical turn-based battle system that emphasizes interrupts and counters. Standing in your way is an intelligent Adversary system with enemy officers that evolve and move up in the ranks.

Possess enemy characters to absorb their unique skills and adapt your combat style to different circumstances. Free your Kingdom by fighting the evil presence that has corrupted your home. Introduction to the Rogue Spirit world: For thousands of years, the people of the Kingdom of Midra lived in relative harmony and peace. From generation to generation, the oldest of tales were told over and over again. The stories told of the great Chaos: A Demon King who was sealed away by a hero of long-forgotten ages. Over time, the residents of the land turned the tale into a legend, then a myth, until it was all but forgotten. Days passed by in this peaceful slumber. The denizens' obliviousness to their own terrifying past weakened the chains of the prison containing the Demon King, until one day they finally broke. The Chaos awakened and the horrifying nightmares of the forgotten past came back to life. He was once more known to every inhabitant of the land – child, adult and elderly alike. He sowed fear in the hearts of the brave, as an inevitable war came along with him. Those who could fight did, and fell. Those who were not strong enough to fight were possessed by demonic energy. The Chaos left no warrior's body alone and absorbed it into his army. Leaving no hostages behind, he incorporated inhabitants across all social classes and sorts, from lowly beggars to the noblest lords. His power grew to be so unimaginable that no mortal could stand against it. As a final resort, the Last Ones, monks of the Forgotten Monastery who still have a memory of what once happened, performed the ritual of summoning to bring back from the spirit world our Hero who sealed away the Chaos in the distant past.

It’s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead…and that’s before things really get ugly. It’s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. It’s a place where the right kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two along the way. As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched Vegas Strip, you’ll be introduced to a colorful cast of characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or declare “winner takes all” and crown yourself the King of New Vegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year, Fallout 3. Enjoy your stay. Key Features Feel the Heat in New Vegas! Not even nuclear fallout could slow the hustle of Sin City. Explore the vast expanses of the desert wastelands – from the small towns dotting the Mojave Wasteland to the bright lights of the New Vegas strip. See the Great Southwest as could only be imagined in Fallout. Feuding Factions, Colorful Characters and a Host of Hostiles! A war is brewing between rival factions with consequences that will change the lives of all the inhabitants of New Vegas. The choices you make will bring you into contact with countless characters, creatures, allies, and foes, and determine the final explosive outcome of this epic power struggle. New Systems! Enjoy new additions to Fallout: New Vegas such as a Companion Wheel that streamlines directing your companions, a Reputation System that tracks the consequences of your actions, and the aptly titled Hardcore Mode to separate the meek from the mighty. Special melee combat moves have been added to bring new meaning to the phrase “up close and personal”. Use V.A.T.S. to pause time in combat, target specific enemy body parts and queue up attacks, or get right to the action using the finely-tuned real-time combat mechanics. An Arsenal of Shiny New Guns! With double the amount of weapons found in Fallout 3, you’ll have more than enough new and exciting ways to deal with the threats of the wasteland and the locals. In addition, Vault-Tec engineers have devised a new weapons configuration system that lets you tinker with your toys and see the modifications you make in real time. Let it Ride! In a huge, open world with unlimited options you can see the sights, choose sides, or go it alone.

Unlike 'proper' games, Endless Knight lets you continue to fight even after you have become separated from your limbs. Sadly the game does not permit the battle to continue after your friends actual death, for 'technical' reasons. Murdered and humiliated all your friends? That's okay, it happens to us all. Lucky for you, Endless Knight also features a not entirely 'tacked-on' single player experience, complete with an absurd story and songs! Slaughtered your way through the wonderfully crafted story mode? Take on the challenging but probably not impossible 'Final Fifty' mode for the ultimate climax of murderous satisfaction. Mmmmmmm. Completed 'Final Fifty'? Oh no, that's pretty much all there is. The mechanics of Endless Knight are different from what you’d find in most fighting games. There are no combos or 'special moves'. The focus is on reaction based blocking, as failure to block will have dire consequences. Due to this alternative focus, Endless Knight might take a few minutes to adapt to, but we hope that once you get the gist, you will love it as much as we do!

388010,Tick: The Time Based Puzzle Game,"Aug 20, 2015",0 - 20000,0,0,2.99,0,"Tick: The Time Based Puzzle Game is a puzzle game unlike any you have seen or played before. Set on the backdrop of unique minimalist art style you will test your timing and your patience as you play through multiple different game modes. Practice mode gives players the ability to let them choose the stages they want to practice on, you can either choose a stage directly from Stage Mode or build your own level using the level editor and play that. Stage Mode is a casual game mode where you have the ability to play at your own pace working your way through 50 increasing difficult stages, the amount of retries and/or failed attempts you commit while working your way through the 50 stages are tracked and evaluated so they can be shown off to friends or posted on Steam. Speed Mode is a more competitive game mode that samples some of the hardest stages in the game, and then times how long it takes for you to work your way through them, final times can be posted on the Steam community page to see who #1 is. This is the first release by Fingertip Games UK which is a new indie start-up being run by one sole developer. If it was not for the support of the Steam community through the Steam Greenlight pathway, this game and start-up would truly not exist today. The game managed to garner major feedback during its Greenlight campaign and these inputs and supportive comments have gone a long way in shaping the future updates for the game. I’d like to give a big thank-you to everyone who either supported us in the Greenlight campaign or have bought the game thus far (and people who will hopefully purchase the game in the future), every little bit of support we can get helps to keep me working on things that people hopefully enjoy. 2016 is going to be a busy year for the game, starting with the January 2016 update V1.1, the game has been streamlined and re-coded from the ground up so it’s ready to support the slew of content that is planned throughout the year. V1.2 is planned for a late March/April 2016 release and will contain the following: - Adds 2 new core game mechanics. (Details closer to release) - Adds 20 new stages to Stage Mode. - Adds another sample to Speed Mode. - Improves and expands some capabilities of the Level Editor. (Details closer to release) V1.3 is planned for a late August/September 2016 release and will contain the following: - Adds 30 new stages to Stage Mode. - Adds the random sample capability to Speed Run. (Details closer to release) - Adds 3 new Mini-games. (Details closer to release) V1.4 is planned for a late September/October 2016 release and will contain the following: - Visual Upgrade to ball movements and effects. - Implements physics based particle effects and responses. - Implements the color palate options where you can color the UI and objects in the game to fit your own style. - Implement the ability to share levels you create in the Level Editor through either a copy or paste code or the Steam Workshop.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/388010/header.jpg?t=1453058270,http://www.fingertipgames.co.uk/,http://www.fingertipgames.co.uk/,fingertipgamesuk@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,4,3,,5,0,,0,0,0,0,Fingertip Games UK,Fingertip Games UK,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Includes level editor","Casual,Indie,Strategy","Strategy,Indie,Casual","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/388010/ss_a39e114f165f930966ca7053c0f28a588f3b3401.1920x1080.jpg?t=1453058270,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/388010/ss_ca1f37d8246f21c415be337e2726ca466fd5579f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1453058270,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/388010/ss_aea5f01272edf7452ac4d8301daba592d10a165c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1453058270,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/388010/ss_1c9b2548a28a88a530b52df304a2c2fed7f74053.1920x1080.jpg?t=1453058270,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/388010/ss_7ef4611a11e0908da2258c59d1eb5f019451fb0c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1453058270,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/388010/ss_bbcc070c65bb0a314ba91afc5977c1425c6af08e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1453058270,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/388010/ss_21b796dc987b2bde68b3157d9bf011b87bdad8f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1453058270,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/388010/ss_7200e8ec4d6c199b796c09d20500961be040cda7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1453058270,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/388010/ss_3a2aa705ec73b73906d094b6cf32c19aa9767326.1920x1080.jpg?t=1453058270,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/388010/ss_3661301e2b583004047d2e9fa545d4e28373427d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1453058270","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256659870/movie_max.mp4?t=1452977478,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256659871/movie_max.mp4?t=1452977489"

1271260,Land of Screens,"Feb 4, 2022",0 - 20000,2,0,5.99,0,"When a recent breakup lights Holland’s social media ablaze, she hopes to find some breathing room out in the real world—but as plugged-in as everyone is, it seems impossible that she'll ever get a break. In Land of Screens, guide Holland on her new mission to ditch the social media saturation and discover some real-world relationships by enlisting the help of a few new friends, some synthy chiptune jams, and the inimitable chemistry of small children and adorable animals. A Point-And-Click Adventure of Internet Escapism Put on your fanciest mingling cap to conquer harrowingly familiar challenges such as: Navigating an impromptu party where your only choices of company are strangers—or worse: friends you haven’t seen since high school. Meandering through a hotel lobby to force awkward introductions with fellow attendees of a professional conference. Making the best of last-minute concert plans where you’ve never heard of the band, been to the venue, or met any of the people you’re there with. Family. Reunions. Getting your friends excited about doing nature stuff so they can convince other people to start doing nature stuff so you can all spend the day doing nature stuff. Just Get Everyone to Stop Looking at their Phones… No Problem. No matter where Holland goes to try and get away, everyone is glued to their screens. She’ll need the help of old friends and new acquaintances—and they’ll need help from her—to dodge the online madness and finally unplug for a while. By diving (or stumbling) into fresh experiences, new relationships, and accidental adventures, Holland might just stand a fighting chance of escaping the ever-present creep of social media drama. Remember How Nice it is to Talk at People’s Actual Faces? In a world stuck on digital connections, the only way Holland is going to get through this breakup with her sanity intact is to go analog. Fortunately, she’ll soon learn just how many enticing adventures are out there, away from the continuous social media commentary.

907190,GRITS Racing,"Mar 4, 2019",0 - 20000,0,0,9.99,0,"Strap on your dandy Tesla Shield and hop in your “Billy Bub” jalopy! GRITS Racing is a party game for up to 8 players that is part racecar simulator, part cartoon action. First, we built the most realistic 2D racer ever... and then we smashed it up into a bizarre party game out of a desire to play a “racing” game with more than just racing fans. We provide a physics playground with sim-like cars, minimal rules at the start, and you decide what to do with it by adding wacky rules between races. Good luck keeping your wheels on! ⚡ Includes the best 6-8 player couch minigame on the planet: Prison Dodgecar! Whaaaaat??? Old school gets a new-school makeover with more damageable physics objects than you can shake a two-dimensional polygon at. And, oh, the skids marks! Did we mention the oddly-satisfying skid marks that dirty up the track like never before? And the dirt doesn't end there. With debris everywhere from lost wheels, broken cars, oily tire tracks, various track objects, and up to 8 players on one screen generally making a mess of it all, just getting to the finish line can be a friend-testing brawl of gasoline-fueled tenacity. Welcome to the petrolpunk world of Globetrotter Racing where it's 1975, The Great War was the only world war, and microelectronics do not exist... probably because no one cared about going small after Nikola Tesla and his research institute learned to harness the power of lightning—to put it simply—and invented the Tesla Shield™ for use in automotive safety and generalized pedestrian protection (GPP). GRITS Racing is a family-friendly game for discharging some electricity in a safe environment. If somebody isn't laughing, giggling, snickering, or snorting most of the game... we aren't doing our job correctly. We get it, not all players will choose to race, so we've given them other ways to be part of the environment (for better or for worse). Features Realistic 2D car physics: Proprietary physics code These 2D cars actually steer via the wheels! Nearly all other games in this category just pivot their cars on center. We don't. You may not see a difference, but take a car for a spin and you will feel it. Quite possibly more realistic than a multiplayer couch game needs to be. Car body and wheels modeled as individual physics objects 4-wheel drive (AWD actually) 4-wheel steering (rear steering tapers off at speed) 4-speed transmission (plus reverse) modeled on a torque curve 430 ft-lbs (582 N-m) of engine torque Hand brake on the rear wheels Breakable wheel fasteners! What is it like to drive on 3 wheels and 1 stub? How about 1 wheel and 3 stubs? Smashing 2D barrier physics: Several barrier types with various friction coefficients and bounciness Some barriers are nailed down with breakable nails Some barriers are not nailed down at all Barriers take damage and show it Gripping 2D surface physics: Several surface types with various traction and drag coefficients Dry, wet, and oily variants Oil slicks Slicks appear organically when and where cars are broken apart during the race Slicks don't artificially wipe you out but only make whichever tires touch it slick If you can't handle a car with oil on some of the tires, that's your problem Oil slickness on tires tapers off over distance Skids and other tire marks vary in width by direction and vary in color by surface Mayhem Model 1-A: Pancake batter!* Pit stops to apply more pancake batter and replace missing wheels Drivers can fall out of cars in collisions Cars can be broken apart after all wheels are lost 4 cars per race (run to your trucks to launch your next car) Tesla Shields™ Force field that protects drivers from cars while on foot This can be very bad for naughty drivers Le Mans starts Seen any other games with this? Not all barriers are nailed down! (oh, yeah, we said that already) 8 players on one screen Bubba Prizes! Save and share game photos showing off the mess ya'll made of the track Mayhem Model 1-B: 5 oddball A.I. personalities for 4 A.I. cars (from speed racer to student driver; one car sets its personality based on number of players) Most A.I. features are now done but A.I. tuning will continue Mayhem Model 2: Wacky Wodifiers that ask “lucky losers” to periodically change the rules of the playground, like: • Greased car seats • Far-out fat tires • Tractor wheels • Dualies • Area 51 Tesla Shields • Reverse-polarity Tesla Shields • Disposable cars • Dragster chutes • Jousting lances • Speed limit for pros • Bring it on (Racing A.I.) • and more to come Leader Lamifiers that force “on-fire” players to add a rule to make things more difficult for the race leader, like: • Greasier car seat • Leader trikes • King of the hill • Finish-line showboating required • and more to come Tabletop mode 😲: Because games are more fun around a table (or on the floor) Prison Dodgecar minigame: Tesla Shields™​ installed on the car instead of the driver Like bumper cars meets billiards Hockey minigame ( Sansstíkdisco ​ in some countries): Tesla Magnets™ for run-n-gun puck control * The pancake batter story. Many years ago a racer was having trouble with the wheel lug nuts staying tight. So, in desperation, he was looking about his pit area for a new idea to fix it when he spied his leftover pancake batter from breakfast. He thought “It couldn't possibly be any worse, could it?” Well, actually, yes, it was worse. Much worse. But the crowd loved the results and the rest is lost in history. No one remembers for sure who this racer was but legend has it he was called Juan Tabo. Official records proving the existence of Jaun Tabo have yet to be found but this hasn't stopped governments from naming libraries and schools in his honor. The sport, then known as Wiggle Wheel Wacing, languished in the backwoods of the Southern United States for years before Gilded-Age billionaire, Billy Bub Worcestershire, bought the rights to it and turned it into the mid-budget international sport known as Globetrotter Racing. Mr. Worcestershire had previously made his fortune with the invention and popularization of deep-fried grits biscuits and, as he stated it, “I understand food batter and believe in the future of all its lucrative properties.” Deep-fried grits also became the sport's official snack food. When the Tesla Institute later developed the personal plasma energy shield (PPES), or Tesla Shield™, Mr. Worcestershire incorporated these shields into Globetrotter Racing and this variant, coincidently, became known as GRITS (Globetrotter Racing Incorporated, á la Tesla Shields). Apparently influenced by GRITS' stock-car cousin, Banger racing, the official snack food of GRITS became bangers and grits (deep fried and otherwise). Still reading?

With Dorfromantik, you can immerse yourself in a quiet, peaceful world at any time and take a break from everyday life. At the same time, Dorfromantik offers a challenge for those who are looking for one: To beat the highscore, you need to carefully plan and strategically place your tiles. In Dorfromantik you start with a stack of procedurally generated tiles. One after the other, you draw the top tile of the stack, place it on one available slot and rotate for the best fit. Thereby groups and combinations of landscapes are formed, such as forests, villages or water bodies, and you are rewarded with points depending on how well the tile fits. On some tiles you will also encounter special objects that give you a quest: For example, the windmill wants to border 6 grain fields, the locomotive wants to be connected to 10 tracks or the deer wants to inhabit a forest with at least 50 trees. Fulfill these quests to get more tiles to continue the expansion of your landscape. The game ends when the tile stack is used up. As you expand the landscape, you can advance into new, colorful biomes and discover pre-placed game objects that give you long-term tasks. Through these tasks you can unlock new tiles, new biomes and new quests. What Dorfromantik offers Building endless and beautiful landscapes Unique mix of strategy and puzzle mechanics Relaxing and calming gameplay Idyllic village scenery Strategic placement to beat the highscore High replay value - every session is different Many unlockable tiles and biomes Original Artstyle with handpainted boardgame feel What Dorfromantik does not offer 4X Strategy Trading Resource Management Combat &amp; Violence Multiplayer Dorfromantik offers options for any style of play!

747230,Cosmic Buddies Town,"Jan 5, 2018",0 - 20000,0,0,2.99,0,"Cosmic Buddies Town is a trip into a colourful living ecosystem, where our friendly characters work together to build their new home. Part of an Animated Educational series for children between 1 to 7 years old – this time, we need to get straight to work helping the Cosmic Buddies build their town! Collect wood, food and other resources to turn a deserted island into your dream adventure land! Kids will love the colourful cast of monsters who will join them in creating their own personalised town. Each character brings a different set of important values for children: friendship, love, respect and teamwork. In addition, fun minigames will help children to develop memory, reflexes and shape identification. The story of Cosmic Buddies begins on Titius, which is located between Neptune and Pluto, 50.4 astronomical units from Earth. Titius is a world full of biodiversity, beauty, peace, respect and love. Titians have existed for a very long time, many years before humans. They are colourful, smart and small. One day six Titians - Grutius, Bobotius, Lili, Ned, Goratius and Maca are playing together when a mysterious object appears in the sky. The friends aren't frightened; they are curious and keen to find out more about the object. Suddenly without any warning, there is a big bright flash and the friends are magically transported to planet Earth. Grutius and Rox (his balloon) Aspect: Sweet Height: Miniature Temperament: Grumpy Among the Tituans, Grutius belongs to the smallest of the species. He has the personality traits of a boss and can be authoritarian sometimes. He tends to be defensive and doesn’t trust easily, often reacting to a situation with a negative outlook. He will need to learn to be more optimistic, acquire a positive mind in order to build a more positive future. He also needs to learn to be more patient and more trusting of people and his friends. Grutius believes that being optimistic is a waste of time and prefers to think negatively in order to avoid disappointments. He can also be lazy and believes that work is too hard; you will often find him sitting around while the others work. Grutius can be proud and sometimes unfriendly but if you treat him well, he can become docile and even shy sometimes, especially around Lili. He can lack self-esteem and is in need of love and affection. His loyal friend is Rox the balloon. Rox has an enquiring mind and is eager to learn. He likes to investigate and asks lots of questions. He is keen to find out how they mysteriously arrived on Planet Earth, but his curiosity doesn’t end there, he also wants to find out more about the meaning of life and the universe. Rox has a sweet attitude and children will find him adorable and easy to fall in love with. Bobotius Jr. Aspect: Gentle Height: Tall (like Bigfoot) Temperament: Passive and Sweet A long time ago the Bobotius were once considered as slaves on Titius. As a species they are harmless and humble and Bobotius Jr. is Grutius’s friend. He has many of the characteristics that Grutius should aspire to. He doesn’t talk very much, but is very intelligent and he’s a little in love with Lili, even if they are just friends. Bobotius Jr. will learn how to grow up and take risks when needed. He will show us that he can become a leader and that good always triumphs over bad. He is the protector of the group and all his friends sleep in his warm arms every night to feel safe. Lili Aspect: Quirky, colourful, open and attractive Height: Tall and thin Temperament: Impulsive, outgoing, charming, passionate and flirtatious Lili is the only girl, she is very smart and loves to read and learn about new things. She is enthusiastic and always sees the positive side of life, but can be temperamental and gets angry sometimes. She is a passionate monster who helps the group by devising strategies to get back home or to achieve their goals on Earth. She always carries her shoes around because she has not learned how to put them on yet. Ned and Lili are always together trying to find solutions to their problems. She will eventually fall in love with Ned because they share the same point of view, interests and passion for physics and chemistry. Lili is on the look out for her soulmate and later in the story she will find them; it will be the person who helps her to tie her shoelaces. She will learn how to be brave in tough situations, how to cook and find food to take care of herself and her friends. Lili will discover a passion for movies and will go to Hollywood to achieve success and fame as an actress. Ned Aspect: Very smart Height: Normal Temperament: Humble Ned is nerdy, he loves science and technology and playing videogames. He is a descendant from the planet Neptune known for their great achievements in science and at a very young age he already had the knowledge of a physicist. He is sweet but shy and sometimes doesn’t know how to express his feelings. In the story, Ned will learn how to express his emotions, control his bad behavior and help to discover the reason why they are on Earth. He believes that we were all made from the coming together of small particles of energy after the universe was created. He will share his beliefs with Lili and his friends to create a galaxy transporter in the hope they can get back to Titius and tell their parents all about the great adventures they had on planet Earth. Ned will be the one who tells his friends all about new technologies and he will be the first one to take a flight to discover another continent. Goratius and Maca Aspect: Gorilla Height: Very Big Temperament: Rude Goratius and Maca are bound together by a belt; they are inseparable and can’t live without each other. Goratius is Maca’s bodyguard. After the bright flash happened and they were transported to Earth, they were the only ones that suffered radiation poisoning from the secondary effects of space warp. After this, they become evil and start to spend all their time thinking about how they can cause harm to everyone. In the story they will start to feel guilty about their behavior and try to improve themselves and become better friends. When they are mean, their colour is dark and when they are good their colour is bright. Maca looks like a bat. Before the story ends they will eventually learn that being good is better than being bad. They will win the fight to suppress their urge to do bad things, which will make them become stronger. However, even though they are friends they will sometimes rebel against each other. During their adventures around the world they will they learn to speak new languages. They will also learn how to be respectful, how to share and how to love each other. Goratius is strong and takes up boxing, his experiences will teach him how to think by himself and make his own decisions without being pressured or controlled by Maca (the little brain of the team).","['English', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/747230/header.jpg?t=1515508009,http://www.cosmicbuddies.com/game.php,http://www.funboxmedia.co.uk/contact/,,True,False,False,0,,0,2,1,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,"Ghost Clusters,NYX Digital Ltd","Funbox Media Ltd,KISS ltd",Single-player,"Simulation,Strategy","Strategy,Simulation","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/747230/ss_af51b6e2957832a770976f2f8bbf9fbcc6764c25.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515508009,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/747230/ss_8f88bdddcbb65b8d885e60a194e441cc95a5fbc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515508009,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/747230/ss_503cb05e38c3fb85414de4241bfb3dc618aad83f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515508009,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/747230/ss_8cc7b7944d73ce854d771b7dba1af76cd8093737.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515508009,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/747230/ss_975cb5e2349149fd77bc1f762e8b6d3b6254bc12.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515508009,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/747230/ss_5db3fc47ab1e5cbde9753c69a603e00d5c9f1a02.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515508009",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256701597/movie_max.mp4?t=1515078679

1156200,VirtuaLiron - Immersive YOGA practice,"Nov 14, 2019",0 - 20000,0,0,3.99,0,"Welcome to our virtual yoga practice. The session we’ve built is suitable for everyone, both beginners and those already on the yoga path. During the practice we want to strengthen our attentiveness. We practice to the exact extent of our abilities at this moment, and from the principle of non-injury, or AHIMSA. During the practice we are attentive to our bodies, especially our breathing, it directs us. Practice is performed unhurriedly, quietly. Yoga is restraining the fluctuating consciousness, without tension and without strength. If during the VR session you experience dizziness, discomfort or pain, it’s always possible to stop and take off the headset. The session will stop automatically and will resume when the headset is put on again. The more we recruit our awareness during the session, the more the practice will be complete and deeper. The VirtuaLiron yoga practice package includes 3 sessions of different length. 30, 60 and 90 minutes. You can choose the form of the teacher from 3 different avatars: A female body avatar where subtle changes in the body colors indicate the breathing sequence. A muscle model avatar where you can see during the practice which muscles are exerting force, and a skeleton avatar that shows the bones structure, engulfed in a transparent body envelope. The teacher will always be in your field of view, regardless where your head is pointing to. This is a fundamental advantage over practice in the real world. You do not need to exit the posture or the flow of movement in order to see what the teacher is doing. While you practice, your head rotation also determines the angle you will see the teacher from.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/header.jpg?t=1574172702,http://www.virtualliron.com,http://www.virtualliron.com,oevenzohar@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,0,2,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Oshri,Even Zohar,Single-player,"Casual,Indie,Sports","Indie,Casual,Sports,VR","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/ss_4e2db10b43205207b7cff6c9ddb1f5a2fb0f7c47.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574172702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/ss_95981e8152fb03a5a686f85bda2462d96f1304e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574172702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/ss_6212cc213ceada5640d124afbb95a44dffaa3342.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574172702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/ss_34e0986367eb7cb21242b12b2520c565e68b22eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574172702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/ss_1e3b6b0dd033b510f04df9d6b7a32e5566306624.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574172702",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256767050/movie_max.mp4?t=1573555894

The world around you is not real - it's only a high-quality multi-level simulation. Due to a virus attack on the basic simulator system, the program was corrupted and all living entities disappeared from the world and have been replaced with virus cells, eating the remains of the matter. Hope fades by the minute, and the higher beings are planning to reset the simulation, beginning the long process of evolution all over again. If that happens, the world will never be the same. Simply changing the basic code while it's being run is no longer possible, but fortunately, all is not lost! You, a being from the outside world, have been sent as a drastic last resort to clear the viruses from inside the simulation.

Each tile you move to transforms you into a different weapon: on a Blades hex you can slice enemies on either side of you, on an Arrow you can launch yourself through two enemies in a row. Between waves, you choose how to build out the grid, and upgrade your most used hexes with new abilities. Hammer: lets you stay put and smash a single enemy in front of you Blades: kill enemies on either side as you move Arrow: plunge right through an enemy and come out the other side Repair: repairs any damage you've taken when you move here Teleport: move to anywhere else on the grid Acid: strips tough enemies of their armour, leaving them vulnerable Killing bugs earns you upgrades for your hexes, and each hex type can be cross-bred with every other type to take on some of its properties. Upgrade an Arrow with Acid and it can kill armoured enemies. Upgrade a Hammer with Blades and you can kill three enemies at once without moving. Upgrade a Teleporter with a Repair and you'll be healed each time you teleport. Upgrades can even be stacked, so you can end up with an Arrow that propels you with infinite range, kills everything in your path, penetrates armour, knocks back everyone near your destination, heals you, and doubles as a teleporter. The idea for tiles determining your weapon came from the iOS game Imbroglio by Michael Brough, which is great, and Morphblade is developed and released with his permission.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/494720/header.jpg?t=1568021619,http://www.pentadact.com/,,pentadact+morphblade@pentadact.com,True,False,False,0,,0,473,43,,0,216,,30,0,30,0,Suspicious Developments,Suspicious Developments,Single-player,"Casual,Indie","Casual,Indie,Strategy,Turn-Based,Hex Grid,Puzzle,Singleplayer,Turn-Based Strategy,Top-Down,2D,Turn-Based Tactics,GameMaker,Rogue-lite","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/494720/ss_4b6d10a95f078da6801ff88a2607120fb35ac116.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568021619,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/494720/ss_6afdf5cc80590a8dcfb63b6dbd4d215a564b5291.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568021619,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/494720/ss_8e42fb228987c252fe7a2231f771b25e728a7a59.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568021619,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/494720/ss_5bf38a4b77a4119af67baed4f52fd5a66439fcea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568021619,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/494720/ss_e75a52d703abe599692456b43523c0a6720bbc80.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568021619,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/494720/ss_3fef121a86c9e21adda4a2e188ba073fd0ce6ff2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1568021619",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256680188/movie_max.mp4?t=1488326824
503620,Fictorum,"Aug 9, 2017",100000 - 200000,4,0,9.99,1,"A reign of terror never feels so satisfying as when you leave a literal pile of rubble in your wake. Giving wizards a much-needed makeover, Fictorum is an action role-playing game that features fully-destructible structures, a randomized node-based world map, and a satisfying magic system with on-the-fly spell shaping and customization. In Fictorum, your mage wields real, legendary power right from the start—unlike those found in most magic-centric games. Our magic system uses a dynamic and intuitive spellcasting and shaping system that grants the player an unrivaled level of customization and reconfiguration. Up to three runes can be applied to a spell, each affecting a different spell characteristic. The runes are easily swapped to suit the player’s current need, interest, or whim. You might amplify ice blasts to freeze enemies in place, expand the radius of a fireball explosion to crumble a bridge and hinder pursuers, or chain a lightning attack together to strike several targets in a cluster. Shaping makes spellcasting much more tactical and satisfying. Rather than starting out as a hapless farm boy who stumbles into his powers and avoids enemies or entire areas until leveling up, players take on the role of an established wizarding badass, hell-bent on his mission for revenge. Yet challenge is abundant—the wizard must bring down a sprawling empire by himself, besting scores of bandits, cadres of Inquisitors, and hordes of corrupted abominations on his quest for vengeance. The protagonist has access to unlimited magical powers, making the game less about spamming that one spell that works passably well until it becomes upgradable. The experience is more about tailoring your magical arsenal, giving the player a wide range of freedom and the ability to effectively, efficiently, and enthusiastically destroy every obstacle. The randomly-generated world map features locations where every structure (from large buildings to bookshelves to tables to even a lone fork) can be demolished.",['English'],['English'],"“Fictorum deliveries on the promises it makes and is an enjoyable experience. It might look and feel a bit dated don’t let that put you off what is a brilliant title. If you can get yourself lost in it’s spellcasting and shaping mechanic then you will find a lot of fun to be had.” 7.5/10 – Game Grin “If you don’t know what you are doing, Fictorum can be fun; if you do, then it is downright addicting. It’s a game that invites you to learn its intricacies, but you may not want to, and that’s fine; however, if you do go through the effort, you may turn into a mage-god, capable of delivering menacing destruction at a whim.” 7.5/10 – Neowin",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/header.jpg?t=1648560242,http://www.fictorum.com,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fictorum,scrapingbottomgames@gmail.com,True,False,False,64,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fictorum?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,772,229,,67,893,,151,0,198,0,Scraping Bottom Games,Scraping Bottom Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards","Action,Indie,RPG","Action Roguelike,Magic,Destruction,Third-Person Shooter,Choose Your Own Adventure,Rogue-lite,Rogue-like,Action RPG,RPG,Third Person,3D,Funny,Procedural Generation,Action,Colorful,Fantasy,Combat,Singleplayer,Physics,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_c1043f92786e2d90a21a741d11d542c5e94cdaba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_dddbe66b3cd4b0df384546f3252bc02463cfca5f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_0e3a43d4cf6b333ff0458ad5cd35c969c4612796.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_615d02680fbd79967dca9a1f5679a8308734777c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_97a253097f8b9e4df12e7c0e34e16beb7d47d4c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_1f1d6915379f8319baeca1ade258a7c03aae09e5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_7a55ad7cca1e151b4d7d419a2321d6c68536e271.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_95e89864493164a975f1f2e9e01c9994499fbe3e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_590ee500c40e37b17e9e17ac294b630bc0593b3f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_fb4b4ddff197d3dc81135c6e97ab70215efeb642.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_b8d1da20590c130358ade00a095e549d458c5818.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_377b4b3f30b7d229626f16b034034056428f3c6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/503620/ss_cdc5fb3d9874f7d14ccd8016ca30e1bbabca64b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648560242",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256767238/movie_max.mp4?t=1573755199

A unique feature in Ne no Kami is the use of videos to illustrate battles and action, dynamically changing the pace and tension. ~At dawn, the moonlight illuminates the old capital enveloped in fog. Guided by fate, bound by their thoughts, the maidens dance. Amid a spiral of despair, the beloved princess and her guardian knight overcome their fear. Gazing up at the dawn sky, the princess of the earth gently averts her eyes. Descended from the heavens, bearing her dreams. Scooping up the ripples from the water's surface. The princess of the sun gazes, and contemplates. Light dwelling in their cerulean eyes, and with a will that can break down the wall of fate. The dancing maidens of the old capital become the princess knights.~ A large earthquake rocks Kyoto at its core, unsettling the balance of the world. Through television and radio, news of absurd behaviors and emergence of cults became frequent, and demons sightings were reported all throughout Japan. But with the passage of time, society's belief in the supernatural was fading and the people's interest would eventually return to the mundane, regular life. The demons were no longer seen, and the world has become 'peaceful' at the surface. Not long thereafter, the events of the earthquake were all but forgotten. Len has been living her entire life as a regular high school student. But suddenly, she is reunited with Shinonome, her childhood friend from long ago, and receives the ominous message- “Len, you are going to abandon this town... and die—today” Since her reunion with Shinonome, Len's life is thrust into an all new “reality,” and the curtain which hid the “truth” of this new world is been lifted. Len and Shinonome must tempt fate and face a world in which reality is all but blurred, as the truth of this world comes to light. Thrilling yuri adventure from Kyoto based independent developer Kuro Irodoru Yomiji. Vibrant and well written cast of female protagonists. Discover their growing love and affection in a world of mystery and folklore. Superb art direction brings characters to life. Video and animation assist the action for truly dynamic storytelling.

Only a few of you will be able to get out alive. You will need to travel the fastest route leaving the bunker through one of the exits, simultaneously fighting foes with improvised weapons. They will also try to stop you with all their might. 1) Players can win by escaping through one of the exits. Each exit is accessed with a special key. The player must go though the intermediate stage, depending on path chosen, in order to leave the bunker. 2) Dynamic gameplay stimulates radiation, which gradually accumulates.

Combining them should make your games feel unique. All items are locked in caches. Open them with 3 unique keys (should be found first). 5) Ability to create weapons and consumables on the workbench for parts scattered across the level. This helps to reduce situations where the player cannot get something if they just have a bad luck. 6) A large multi-level location with many workarounds.

Frightened, she jumps on the train and finds it full of unusual passengers--the ghosts of people who died on the Runaway Express over the 50 years it ran between Paris and Istanbul. Each ghost is a victim, his or her mysterious demise never fully investigated. These lost souls are cursed to ride the train until someone has the courage to go back in time and reveal the truth about their deaths. Do you dare to break the curse?

Archeo: Shinar, because that's the full title, is a turn-based strategy video game focused on people &amp; resources management. It's not like other games about archeologists doing astonishing stuff in ancient tombs or something like that. No. In this game you will be the man behind the desk. Or a woman. We are talking about the lifestyle of the real archeologists, the true horror of dealing with traumas and phobias. Not yours! You won't risk your own health, we have employees to do that. The true horror of dealing with their traumas and phobias. Do you see where I'm going with it? Imagine the bills from doctors, the health compensations and the press. 'Press? Why the press?' you ask. Yes, the press. Because you know the press. They are just waiting there for the unsatisfied explorer who would like to tell them how the 'archeology' truly works. And we do not speak about how it truly works. They can't know the ugly truth. Never! That's a lot of stress, right? Don't worry, as we already know, there is no better medicine for that than a cup of tea. Or a glass of gin. Your call. Let's agree this is enough knowledge for now. More information could cause an Epistemophobia, and we don't want that, do we? Please, enjoy the view from your train's window and look forward to our next meeting. .-. -.. -... .--. -.. ... / -.... -... --. -... ...-- .. ..-. .---- -....- ..... -... / .-. -.. -... .--. -.. ... Signed Your Cuppy Archeo: Shinar is an economic turn-based strategy set in the world of archeology. It blends the preparation period (turn-based strategy) with expeditions (real-time strategy) in unique gameplay mixup with a lot of small stories and grotesque humor. Key features Prepare and explore - New, fresh gameplay based on mixup of two genres Turn-based strategy and Real-time strategy. Hire and care - Find your best team and keep them in good shape. Or not, you can always replace them. Money and reputation - Try to get both. Find a balance between them and be the true winner. Collect and invest - There's no better way to get rich than by buying land. What's better than having land? Building your own buildings on your land. It's a great investment. Read and decide - Now and then you will receive a small story to keep your experience interesting. Every time you will have to decide and every time it will have consequences! Opponents and Vanessa - Meet memorable opponents, you won't forget them for a long time. And there's Vanessa. Such a shame she has a wig. Solo or with friends - Play solo or with up to 4 friends (hot seat). But keep in mind that after the game they won't be your friends anymore. Challenge reality - Check the facts, learn more about the history and try to find a proof that the developers were wrong because the world we are going to show you may make you challenge everything. Difficult subjects - Mental illnesses, addictions, thievery, slavery, paradigms, tribal mentality, corruption, pride, and murder. Economy end bankruptcy - Last but not least, do not bankrupt. It's like permadeath. You can withhold salaries only for a certain time, after that they will come. They will come and collect.",['English'],['English'],"“The game is way deeper than it looks.

In hospitals, abandoned classrooms, quiet apartments, and dark forests, strange appearances and unexplainable phenomena test the sanity of residents in Shiokawa, Japan. Is it chaotic retribution, or the machinations of beings beyond our comprehension? This is WORLD OF HORROR: The end of the world is nigh, and the only solution is to confront the terror reigning over the apocalypse. Navigate this hellish, roguelite reality through turn-based combat and unforgiving choices in this roguelite-style cosmic horror RPG. Invoke dark rituals, uncover disturbing clues, and solve puzzles across multiple randomized mysteries. Each perplexing case unravels into a series of random encounters with nightmarish figures inspired by the works of horror legends Junji Ito and H.P. Lovecraft. Choose from five unique characters and solve over 10 mysteries in Early Access. Most mysteries harbor multiple endings - for those that survive long enough.

Events such as Trump's Impeachment or the COVID-19 outbreak create new issues for the voters to consider. As things unfold, you research topics within each new issue, such as Trump's acquittal and the first Covid-19 case in America, and make strategic ad buys to sway voters. While you're off spinning the issues, the candidates don't even know you exist. Their goal is to crush each other, just like the actual election. They apply strategies designed to win over voters using any method they can to win. Your job is to learn what voters think by taking out polls, hacking the candidates, and stealing information from their campaign! Making sure your candidate comes out on top is not going to be easy. The landscape is changing; electioneering mimics this new environment, asking users to choose between hundreds of different Events, Issues, Topics, and Arguments (spin) to reshape the conversation and even the country. Story It's been 4 years since you last got this phone call. It's time. America is choosing a new leader, and the world is watching. Some of us are doing more than watching; we're falsifying information, we're spreading lies. We're Electioneering. This time it's Trump and Biden; it's your job to use all the resources at your disposal to make sure that your candidate wins. Can you convince the voters to ignore what they see, ignore what they feel, and vote your way? Can you lie, cheat, and steal this election? We'll give you a weekly stipend and some contacts; the rest is up to you. If you get caught, we don't know you. If you lose, well. These aren't the kind of people you want to disappoint.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/header.jpg?t=1620588977,http://www.electioneering-game.com,http://www.electioneering-game.com,,True,True,True,0,,0,3,4,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Cosmo's Tuxedo,Cosmo's Tuxedo,Single-player,"Indie,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Early Access,Dystopian,Simulation,Strategy,Political Sim,Indie,Turn-Based Strategy,Alternate History,America,Dark,Political,Conspiracy,Politics,Hacking,Management,Turn-Based Tactics,Grand Strategy,Crime,Cyberpunk,Parody","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/ss_24395c4945c729d51e3a8127792bde1f8da9f2f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620588977,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/ss_214be8e4968e5fcea3410d7ab010c99dfcf318a0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620588977,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/ss_0443022ab20e5674b75fefdb3aead644d58ec1ef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620588977,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/ss_8d8ed426656888662613bead4f5779d82986dd38.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620588977,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/ss_8007c34e93707700d6d88e737eb6cd2d6bc9e9ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620588977,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/ss_1c220a4d32284d07f97fa72436a0c408c8bf2e09.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620588977,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/ss_9dcbde48a196b35b7243b661662c7c4b7e0776f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620588977,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/ss_48443100436506bbe48f811ba82b3f72b28ac6f6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620588977,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/ss_508776e6a2594b801cccf8fab1cc9a3ba331d5aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620588977,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/ss_d24c449d437cfb3e210fe905bd7128627ed0acf6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620588977,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377280/ss_3a2c2d9c35e92dea4ab78561f92b0b19c1484213.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620588977",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256803569/movie_max.mp4?t=1602804341
708260,Text Wormhole,"Nov 2, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,6.99,0,"Text Wormhole is a dodge game of bullet hell generated by the roguelike way dynamically based on the theme of letters, which adopts the minimalist design style. The unprecedented visual spectacle will give you an extraordinary game experience. Introduction: Players need to dodge bullet letters and find the same letters as theirs in the shortest time, so as to enter the next round of the game. The difficulty will gradually increase, and the algorithm generated dynamically is used in each round. The player who finishes this game from A to Z in the shortest time will be the world champion! Features: Limitless charm, and fast pace The speed is very rapid, and a lot of interference letters will show up in each round. Players need to pass the level one after another with only one life. If you hit the wrong letter, you fail! Diverse challenges This game sets over 50 levels, which are combined randomly. Expect what you will encounter for your next challenge! The exploration of visual art The magic music and the crazy pictures bring you to an unprecedented game experience. The original idea of this game came from the team member Harvey Jackson, and this program was his personal project about the course Visual Poetics and Narrative in his postgraduate period. We were shocked by the visual effect, and so we decided to start this challenging project. Two-player mode and fight with your friend! This game supports two players, and quickly invite your friends to challenge it together. Survival mode At the same time, we provide a super difficult survival mode for the veterans of bullet hell, and each round is a purgatory mode. In addition, the game is also equipped with a wealth of content expansion. Steam achievements, leaderboards, full controller support &amp; trading cards! In the meanwhile, we will release more game modes and levels, so please look forward to them!",['English'],['English'],"“It’s pretty great, actually. Beautiful and dangerous, like a Burmese cat with its paw stuck in the door.” rockpapershotgun.com “Welcome to letter hell, folks! Text Wormhole‘s alphabetic twist on bullet hell chaos is a novel test of hand-eye coordination, pattern memorization, and visual recognition. This isn’t a game you’ll necessarily want to play for stretches longer than, say, 10 to 15 minutes at a time, but in short bursts the game proves to be hellacious fun. Overall this is a gaming dollar very well spent.” vgblogger.com “Text Wormhole’s letter swarms are a delight to see in motion. Combined with the adrenaline-pumping soundtrack and frantic bullet hell letter dodging it makes for an intense and very addictive experience that has that all important ‘just one more go’ factor.

Navigate a political drama, driven by conversations with your cabinet members and other significant figures in a country with its own complicated history. With looming border conflicts, entrenched corruption, economic crisis and people desperate for reform, as leader the difficult choices fall on your shoulders as you strive to uphold your election promises. In 1954, the country of Sordland is emerging from a 20-year dictatorship, following a bloody civil war. You play as a charismatic young man, Anton Rayne, who has surprised everyone by rising to the top of the party in power and getting elected as the new President of Sordland. The people are hungry for democratic reforms after decades under a traditionalist power. The economy is in shambles and the political landscape is shifting. Neighboring superpowers are watching closely, and there are military threats on the horizon. As President, you have the final say but every choice you make has an impact. Your colleagues, the opposition, corporations; everyone has a point of view. Think and act carefully: once enacted your choices can not be reversed. Good luck, Mr. President. The game opens with a prologue in which Anton lives through formative events that shape his history from childhood through to the moment he is elected. Take this further by customising your look and style. At the end of Anton’s term, visualize how his choices impacted the country and how he lands on the Sordish political spectrum. Work closely with the Cabinet and prominent figures to forge strong policies and practices. You will need to keep your allies on your side and carefully consider where you will compromise your values and who you will make an enemy of. Everyone has their own ambitions in play. Leading a country is demanding. Face constant conflict about which is more important, serving the country or supporting your family. Is it possible to be a good father and a good president at the same time? Weighty, dramatic conversations : Navigate intricate conversations in this 400K-word branching political drama. Every choice has consequences : Make difficult choices on security, economy, diplomacy and more. Even outside the office, your values and beliefs will be challenged. Make allies and enemies : Interact with a wide array of characters with different personalities and ideologies. The oath of office versus family and values: See the real impact of the choices made in office on your family and close relationships Pay attention to current events : Follow the situation in Sordland through reports and news. What will your legacy be? : You can take the country in many different directions, resulting in one of 9 different major endings. Every decision you make is final: there is an autosave feature that does not allow loading earlier saves.

686910,Delirium,"Aug 31, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,0.0,0,"Delirium is a haunting first-person psychological horror game. A small indie game built around bigger themes of loss, abandonment and self-inflicted misery. You open your eyes in a grungy, gloom ridden room with an old diary as your sole companion. Thus begins your journey that unravels the tragic history of this abandoned house. Each room and each diary pieces together a narrative that traces the history hiding within the wretched walls of this house. But watch your back during your exploration, slithering among the shadowy corners of this house are eyes; unblinking and gliding, peering and tracing you.. Peel back the bitter truth before it's too late and the history of this house repeats itself. Main Features: Exploration Based : The emphasis is to explore this house and discover its secrets through each room. Narrative Driven : the entire game is based on a narrative about this house and its inhabitant. It invites the player to explore to unfold the story. First-Person : Told entirely through first-person perspective for immense immersion. Atmospheric : Atmosphere driven cinematic game, to convey the foreboding and unsettling feeling that the house imposes effectively. Puzzles : There are few doors that need a combination lock or a puzzle to navigate. Diary journals: Diary journals provide first-hand account from the past inhabitant and what occurred to him. It's a short intense journey meant to be played in one setting, so there is no save system. Each restart of the game resets the loop and your nightmare starts all over again. Headphones are strongly recommended to get the best experience. Lastly, I'd like to say that this is a short one-man made game that tries to be ambitious despite its small scope. It's pure indie in its essence and my humble node to all the inspiring horror classic games and cinema that I have grown up with.

Live the horror by the hand of its defining yokais and submerge into the superstitions of the past driven by a unique story and exploration. Ikai embodies the spirit of the classical psychological horror genre with a defenseless main character incapable of attacking the evil creatures. However, it explores a new sense of horror by making the player face the threats directly neither fleeing nor attacking. Every mechanic of the game is meant to raise this relatable feeling of helplessness and create a tense atmosphere. The slow, precise and natural movements as a way of interaction resemble real life’s to foster immersion in the uncanny world of Ikai. STORY Rumors have spread even through the most skeptical villagers, giving way to fear and hysteria. It’s not just a matter of gossip this time. The blood-stained leaves indicate that evil creatures are getting closer and closer to humans. It is believed that a new demon has turned up in the underworld. Its will is to cross the doorway into our world as soon as it finds what it is looking for. Such a situation requires the priest to head to the village, leaving the shrine under his niece’s control, the priestess. The crowd’s fear hasn’t reached the shrine far away in the mountains, where the priestess, Naoko, works as usual, too busy to worry. Sweeping and sweeping, time goes by, with or without the priest. Without giving much importance to this sort of demon and ghost stories she ascribes to fearful children, Naoko leaves the shrine to get to the river before it gets dark. Villagers’ dreads seem to take shape in the gloomy forest. She keeps walking, increasingly tense, until her doubts are dispelled; but not her fears. She soon loses consciousness of her soul and body and falls to the ground; almost dead, almost alive. The shrine’s bell screams for help, but it is no longer a sacred place. All Gods have gone, giving way to monsters, ghosts and spirits. GAMEPLAY FEAR: Experience the horror in first-person by the hand of Japanese spirits, monsters and yokais EXPLORATION: Wander around a feudal shinto shrine and explore to unveil the story behind Naoko, the main character DRAWING: Concentrate on drawing protective seals over the strange sounds and events happening around PUZZLES: Pit your wits against the several puzzles that will try to stop you STEALTH &amp; RUN: Be silent, do not disturb the evil… Or just run, run away from it all, if you can…","['English', 'Spanish - Spain', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Japanese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Traditional Chinese']",“Ikai has some wonderful visuals that make great use of lighting to create a sense of fear and nervousness.” 8/10 – GodisaGeek “Ikai is a solid Japanese horror game that plays with your paranoia to drive the fear!” 8/10 – GameTyrant “[Ikai] brings back that Horror experience that we missed back in the old days of Horror games” 8/10 – Marooners Rock,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1315210/header.jpg?t=1649872169,https://www.endflame.com/ikai,http://www.pm-studios.com,support@pm-studios.com,True,False,False,0,,0,124,25,,20,119,,430,125,430,125,Endflame,"PM Studios, inc.","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support","Adventure,Indie","Horror,Psychological Horror,Atmospheric,Story Rich,Survival Horror,Exploration,Walking Simulator,Adventure,First-Person,Singleplayer,Dark,Puzzle,Action,Mystery,Female Protagonist,Thriller,Narration,Realistic,Psychological,3D","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1315210/ss_72ce2d09476da3dcc025afc250b37211b96e37cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649872169,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1315210/ss_f318e31aa3381477dd725a02981b1e0402582495.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649872169,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1315210/ss_f672fb89259f9a8a3471cc46c2e50f532cff5cdc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649872169,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1315210/ss_a8d8538eb4b522de168448f82ac045fd7a219b2c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649872169,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1315210/ss_f0e4375b9cb23bf85d2c37841457341400562e05.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649872169,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1315210/ss_602b78c311a278d8cfe67a8dc1514f25cc4c01b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649872169,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1315210/ss_3d0c9fea7af89ad2bb01049f8c3ca658da18ced6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649872169,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1315210/ss_d09e7d7d2cb739ebb9525f022168a8e1efbd5716.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649872169,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1315210/ss_0c7d2f65a701451f8cce6889dd4fd5deae57c4ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649872169,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1315210/ss_457369be0469f8f354dfa7a57d3430358e40c49d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649872169","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256880092/movie_max.mp4?t=1648630103,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256837119/movie_max.mp4?t=1623339718"

765880,The Occupation,"Mar 5, 2019",0 - 20000,3,13,29.99,1,"Your role is to uncover evidence as a journalist by sneaking through restricted areas and questioning people on their actions through a series of one-on-one interviews. All this takes place in a detailed, systems-driven world where people will react to your actions and where time is your biggest enemy. At White Paper Games, we focus on world’s that feel lived in through non-linear spaces and objectives that can be solved with multiple approaches. We love games with a strong narrative drive that tackle important social issues and aim to set that standard within our own work. We understand not everyone plays for the deeper narrative experience, and for those that like the idea of trespassing, breaking into secure locations and hacking 4 digit codes, we have plenty of rule breaking opportunities to take advantage of in the world of The Occupation Instead of creating a feature list, we wanted to highlight the cool work our team of 9 have created over the past 4 years of development. Time is a precious resource to us all. Every minute in the game is a real-world minute and The Occupation is played over a fixed time length so make sure your actions count. Your watch can be used to set alarms and timers to help keep track of important objectives such as time delayed safes so you don’t have to hang around whilst security is searching for you somewhere you shouldn't be. Wherever you live, the chances are you’re in a country that could be run a little better, where trust may be feeling a little low. You may not care how their decisions impact you and you instead continue with your daily life ignoring the distracting scaremongering. Or, you may be actively involved in trying to create true change. We love that, in most countries, people have a choice in this, and that’s how we wanted to approach The Occupation’s gameplay design. The world is open for you to explore and it’s up to you what threads you find interesting and wish to follow in the world. Daniel Hillben and Steven Crow are the security guards employed by The Bowman Carson Group and will be around to monitor your activity to make sure you’re not doing anything you shouldn’t be. Daniel Hillben has been with the Bowman Carson Group for many years so try not to get on the wrong side of him. You may have seen the acting work of Steven Crow in advertisements such as ‘Warts Away’ or ‘The Restorer’; Steve is working this security gig to pay the bills but his real aspirations lay in Hollywood. Whether you chose to break into a office through the window, find an ID card or pull the power to the room, we designed the world to accommodate your choice, approach and need to interact with objects you may or may not need for your research. Sincerely, if you read this far and enjoy the work we create, thank you. We put everything we have into these game and we really do appreciate every person that invest their time and hard earned money into the games we create. - The White Paper Team","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Russian']","['English', 'Russian']","“The Occupation is a taut investigative simulation and stealth thriller.

In Trouble In Terrorist Town, you can be a detective solving an online murder as criminals attempt to cover up their homicides.

Dobo has lost that sparkle in his eyes and, little by little, started to get stuck in his own thoughts, creating blockings, shutting himself in a dark room. After a short time, Dobo didn’t seem the same anymore, but few could see him, because he set himself apart from everybody else. Fortunately his family, especially his grandchildren, are making an effort to get him out of his dark room and bring him back to life.

1167530,Ailment,"Oct 23, 2019",0 - 20000,0,0,5.99,0,"Hey guys! My name is Ivan, and I'm the creator of Ailment . I'm a solo developer and this one is my very first game. I started not a long time ago, and it took me around 9 months to complete this game, drawing and coding and doing lots of other stuff related to game development. Originally the game was made for iOS and Android phones, and it was released on May 1, 2019, and it got downloaded around 250K times within 3 months with pretty good reviews (4.6 AppStore/GooglePlay). It became Game of the Day on AppStore on September 28, and it got into the Indie Corner on Google Play Store and still remains there. It seemed insane for me, for a newbie solo-developer who never has made a game before. Players were asking whether Ailment would be released on PC, and now there you go! Check it out and let me know your thoughts! 'I thought this game was just another cheap ad-packed waste, but I started playing and found it fun and challenging. Definitely download' This is a really well put together game! Even for just having one person working on it and handling it, the game looks and feels very professional and is just really fun to play. Within an hour or 2 of playing it, I immediately recommended the game to my friends! All around it's a great game. 'I never write reviews about games or other apps just because I don't get passionate enough to take the time to write a review. However, this game has changed that for me. This game is really well thought out with a bunch of little hidden eggs from space movies. Really enjoyed the game while it lasted. Really hope these guys will come out with another game like this! Would even be paying a few dollars for it.'' 'Lived up to my expectations. I definitely recommend it to whoever is reading this.' Ailment is a pixel-art action game which takes place on a spaceship in a far away galaxy. The main character wakes up in a spaceship after being unconscious for three days to discover the whole crew had turned into enemeis. The last thing he remembers was returning from another ship where he was on a rescue mission, but everyone on that ship was already dead... He has to remember what happened and find out the truth.

727460,Magic Tower,"Dec 31, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,0.99,0,"GamePlay: The game consists of two parts and a combination of defense and escape. 'Exterminate all the monsters' VS 'Help the monster to escape'. The whole process consists of 32 rounds, each round 'defense' and 'escape' play, two play through to the next round. (Because many players do not like to be forced to become monsters, the current version is the default choice to skip the escape mode.) You don't have to destroy all the creatures in the 'Tower Defense'. After each round of play, Hp will be auto reset. You don't have to save all of the same kind in the 'escape' game, and of course it will lose some 'energy'. Each kind of turret has its own unique effect, through the collocation of various turrets to get the best defense. Each kind of monster has its own unique attributes, using the properties of the turret to combat monsters. The core of the game is 'energy absorption'. (similar to 'thieves', 'plunder'). That is, the attack of the defense tower will draw energy from the monster, and accumulating energy can build more defense towers. (it's hard to defend if you have not enough energy.) Features: You don't want this games is so hard? Cheat code is 'greedisgood'. (open the console by press the 'Enter' key in the game) You only want to play 'defense' part?

SCUM aims to evolve the multiplayer open world survival game with unprecedented levels of character customization, control and progression, where knowledge and skills are the ultimate weapons for long-term survival. Combining the methodical planning and management of hardcore survival with optional PvP ‘network events’ available to everyone at anytime, SCUM strikes a unique balance between complex simulation and intense action in the next generation of survival game. SCUM is built with Unreal Engine 4 and will expand throughout the Early Access period. Fans can follow details on development with weekly dev updates on scumgame.com and on Twitter @SCUMgame. FEATURES [ALPHA] Complex Simulation: SCUM utilizes dozens of complex systems to allow players to go as deep as they choose into the management of their character. Players can delve into the minutia of the survival experience through systems controlling their character’s metabolism, inertia during movement, and even how fast layers of clothing dry on and off the body. The devil is in the details... Massive Landscape: Traverse and explore 225 sq km of terrain that includes dense forests, picturesque beaches, serene fields, abandoned towns, and rundown airfields. Each location telling it's own story and filled with wildlife and dangers.The massive terrain can be traversed by foot, land vehicles, boats or aircraft. PvP Network Events: Enter TEC1’s ongoing network events with a click of a button and be whisked to enclosed areas of the island for white-knuckle PvP gameplay. Volunteer for an event and be pitted against other prisoners with fame points and high value loot on the line for those that survive. Expanding Gameplay: While the current version of SCUM already includes basic crafting, combat, and customization systems, the featureset and gameplay will continually expand to include more advanced mechanics, more variety in gameplay, and a metanarrative for players to complete missions with hopes of one day getting off the island... Online Multiplayer: Survive with up to 64 players per server with the option to rent your own server right from the in-game menu.

And it does this all while maintaining an air of realism.” Rock Paper Shotgun “The developers say that they’ve created the most realistic simulation of the human metabolic system ever made, the end result of which is a fairly regular requirement that my avatar urinate and empty his bowels.” Polygon “Owners of the Scum Supporters Pack will get an additional two inches on their unit, which they can swing around as a badge of honor or sacrifice for bonus points elsewhere.

The dynamics of modern games and a well-developed plot with elements of a detective story complement classic control mechanics. The future is here! Use the weapons of the future in a medieval setting. Find out how technology fell into the hands of the people of that time! Your skills and abilities are at the forefront, not the item statistics or the quality of the armor. To complete the game, you have to not only wield your axe or sword, but also use your brains: the dungeons are full of mysteries, secret passages and magic items. Complete quests, explore locations, or simply cut your way further down - in the end you’ll find a secret, which you’d prefer not to reveal.","['English', 'Russian']","['English', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/header.jpg?t=1635761933,https://www.eclipseoffical.com/,,darkalexrus666@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,123,15,,31,123,,0,0,0,0,MadRock,MadRock,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Indie,RPG,Early Access","Early Access,Adventure,RPG,Mystery Dungeon,Top-Down,Atmospheric,Dark,Exploration,Loot,Dungeon Crawler,Rogue-like,Strategy RPG,Action RPG,CRPG,Tactical RPG,3D,Stylized,Alternate History,Futuristic,Magic","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_72c0af7236c8e21cf854c20805f39b12f2fcfe0b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_7c1aa991711bff0929959a4da4cb7bab44067af7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_848328e4f3ff34d85e68d8cba68f1bc63c3cbd05.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_3b889ae5e3233adf986d37319a255eb548d4106d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_677526c3129e654f61713fb94986fb6ec914092a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_6cfe1b41eeb6b33f534cae822d84aaa51311075a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_b2a561267256a390d17c4440a866de273cfac957.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_590c3b0f02adbcd40337f227f4836c1b8b022e91.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_870a8e534f2b03a59fdf8c12d17cfc9f92de7654.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_5e57f66618a662e4e70c4b8640745cb1e8630be0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_96b2f4b86f9aa8c407d6326f27a92cb0ae555c8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_1167bfd0ba0f0349ff15e15b42c54b5484534e63.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_490f1225c24832b7edc7b99b5e0522fab1450b45.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_4d493a2a42b75e8d6f1cc1424d723b06e2953af6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1464380/ss_aecefc3ab2574561dfd9682460ffa1fc2b6df942.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635761933","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256852870/movie_max.mp4?t=1632422935,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256811302/movie_max.mp4?t=1606836024"

Take on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? These features make Nowhere Prophet stand out Card-based tactical combat system New procedurally generated maps each game Find loot and recruit followers to build your deck Unlock new content across multiple playthroughs More than 300 cards for you to discover Indian infused electronica soundtrack A roguelike deck-building game Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. TRAVEL During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. COMBAT You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. A science-fiction post-apocalypse Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.

With this virtual-reality experience I express my own appreciation for and feelings about the gift of life. We need keep our ability to see the world through the wondering eyes of a child. It is a journey within that hopefully will touch you on an emotional level and make you transcend into a relaxed and appreciative state of mind.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093330/header.jpg?t=1619463163,http://epicscapes.de/conscious-existence-virtual-reality.html,,marc.zimmermann@epicscapes.de,True,False,False,0,,0,471,61,,0,521,,0,0,0,0,Marc Zimmermann,EpicScapes,Single-player,Indie,"Indie,Atmospheric,VR,Relaxing,Cinematic,Epic,360 Video,Great Soundtrack,Short,Movie,Family Friendly,VR Only","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093330/ss_51855e4eab90a126c901657939f00a36d868294f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1619463163,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093330/ss_6647f6eab4c2e7b0c4a80d4ac1255adc79636562.1920x1080.jpg?t=1619463163,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093330/ss_2d4c2bca53e2aec61ff72de2c723d32b52c301fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1619463163,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093330/ss_fb14ab20ee1c51ff8e67d426a916c138fa0a7d5b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1619463163,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093330/ss_53f1d5ffa1f8559de596565447fc5748a662eb5e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1619463163,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093330/ss_b5e78e1dd825d2f49f4b323b763da3edc9b9525c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1619463163",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256751473/movie_max.mp4?t=1559043544

979310,Disjunction,"Jan 28, 2021",50000 - 100000,0,0,15.99,1,"2048. Following the arrest of a prominent community leader, New York stands in disarray. Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as ‘Shard’ spreads throughout the underworld. With the city’s future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city’s fate. Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace. Nobody needs to die… unless you decide they must. KEY FEATURES: Challenging stealth-action gameplay that lets you play the way that suits your style, whether it’s sneaking through levels or attacking head-on. Three playable characters, each with individual abilities, cybernetic upgrades and talents to customise your playstyle. A reactive story where the player’s choices have real consequences. Stylized pixel art environments and characters. Atmospheric musical score by composer Dan Farley. Gameplay: Disjunction features unique stealth-action mechanics and abilities for each of its three playable characters, giving players the freedom and flexibility to choose the playstyle that suits them. Tackle encounters in lethal, high-octane combat, or use your wits to stick to the shadows, utilizing distraction techniques and non-lethal attacks to reach your objective. Augmentation: Unlock cybernetic upgrades to augment your abilities via upgrade trees, and build upon your playstyle to improve your stealth or increase the lethality of attacks through talent trees. Find upgrade kits to reach your true potential and become a feared killer or remain anonymous throughout New York's shady underground. Reactive Story: Experience a reactive story shaped by your actions. Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld. Crush entire factions or convince them to aid your cause. Your destiny is yours to write. The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America’s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Japanese']",[],“A cracking first effort from a miniature team.” Recommended – Eurogamer “Recommended to Cyberpunk enthusiasts.” 9/10 – GamesLore “Disjunction might be the Cyberpunk game we’ve all been waiting for.” 90% – TechRaptor,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979310/header.jpg?t=1650620592,http://www.disjunction-game.com/,https://fireshinegames.co.uk/,https://fireshinegames.co.uk/submit-a-support-ticket/,True,False,False,67,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/disjunction?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,89,16,,20,0,,732,0,732,0,Ape Tribe Games,Fireshine Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support","Action,Indie,RPG","RPG,Choices Matter,Story Rich,Detective,Top-Down Shooter,Shooter,Action RPG,Cyberpunk,2D,Top-Down,Multiple Endings,Pixel Graphics,Action,Dystopian,Sci-fi,Stealth,Atmospheric,Conspiracy,Singleplayer,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979310/ss_e36c7354dc4d13dc3371673cf2418715ac544524.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650620592,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979310/ss_90eae621852aa5d4d032c8deefb7ed3b56f69fb0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650620592,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979310/ss_e6e2822ad5e25d91ec4c323d48caf223f7501401.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650620592,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979310/ss_4b77321716f5d8eae56c58d7f30f2e4ff29d69db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650620592,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979310/ss_44b543456e89432d9bd3f4b58cebc67052d30da8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650620592,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979310/ss_57cb74d2aa6c55d310a8bc78a2572d27a7a5d035.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650620592,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979310/ss_bd5b651542a3de7321a55805b38d5ef806ece8f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650620592,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979310/ss_e893162e4f35993e4accb269532919b004d5e783.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650620592","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256822321/movie_max.mp4?t=1613142721,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256820060/movie_max.mp4?t=1611847063,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256817816/movie_max.mp4?t=1610379468"

DEATH RAY MANTA Two sticks, one fish, some flashing lights. Death Ray Manta is, quite definitely, a videogame in the purest sense. Rejigged, rebuilt, remastered for Steam in the year of our Molyneux 2015. Death Ray Manta is a short form top down arena shooter where you blow up enemies using colourful laserbeams. You spawn in the centre of the screen, moments later the screen is filled with mines, robots, rabbits and lasers from beyond the stars. Collect space gems for a bonus and shoot everything else that you can in order to flash lights at yourself. Aim for your own personal high score. How far into fish space can you get? 32 screens of increasingly colourful and crazy laser firing mayhem from the brains behind (amongst other things) Squid Yes, Not So Octopus, SYNSO 2 and the challenge mode in Waves. Also, he's that hairy dude off the internet. You know the one. Death Ray Manta is made with the fine assistance of Mike Daw who provided the legwarmer chic tunes and Andy White, who helped out under the hood and kept me sane.

332360,Spriter Pro,"Nov 14, 2014",50000 - 100000,6,0,59.99,12,"Spriter makes it easy for anyone, regardless of experience , to create 2D game animations using a technique called Modular Animation . Unlike traditional animation which requires each frame to be hand-drawn, Spriter animations are made of individual sprite pieces ; these pieces can be rotated, transformed, and tweened along an animation timeline. This allows you to quickly create great looking animations in a fraction of the time while requiring significantly less art. Spriter also takes advantage of skeletal animation . Create a skeleton using the bone tool, attach images to each bone, and finally animate the bones with Spriter's vast array of user-friendly animation tools. The result: a fully animated sprite using your own graphics. Spriter is great for animating characters, user interfaces, power-ups, combat animations and more! Even if you've never animated before, Spriter provides you with an easy to understand, yet powerful toolset allowing you to jump right in! Spriter Pro includes the Essentials versions of all of our Animated Art Packs, free to use in any of your game projects. Once you install Spriter Pro It they will be located in the following location: /SteamApps/common/Spriter/Art Packs/Essentials Key Features: Using keyframes you can quickly lay out major frame changes. Frames in-between the keyframes are then automatically created. You can then edit individual frames as desired to make your animations really shine. Animations can be exported as spritesheets, animated GIF files, sequential images and more. Reuse your previous animations by incorporating them in new ones. Create perfect, smooth transitions and varieties that save time by working with animations you've already created. Adjust animation easing with several curve settings to help make your animations more lifelike. Create pixel perfect retro style animations with Pixel Art Mode. Spawn bullets, particle effects, or anything that requires precise locations and angles. Set up guide lines and load in background images to work on top of. Seperate characters into important collision areas. Inverse Kinematics. Change a bone's parent, add or remove bones, or even change sprite pieces mid-animation. Import sound effects and even use lip-syncing with built-in Papagayo support. Use Animation Data Directly In Your Game: Animations are recreated in real-time using the sprite piece images just like in Spriter. Animations are much smoother and require drastically less memory as compared to sprite-sheets. Manipulate animations via game events. Reuse your animation data for completely new characters or character customizations. Perfect for characters who gain new clothing, equipment etc. Spriter animations can be imported with full feature support in Unity and Construct 2. There are also free, open source, fully featured reference implementations for using Spriter files in C#, C++, JavaScript, and MonoGame.

1062000,Starmancer,"Aug 5, 2021",20000 - 50000,7,0,19.99,1,"After a catastrophe on Earth, humanity launches the Starmancer Initiative in a desperate attempt to seek refuge among the stars. Millions of refugees upload their consciousness into your memory banks--entrusting their minds and the future of the human race to an Artificial Intelligence, a Starmancer. To you. Stranded in a strange solar system, your task as a Starmancer is to construct and manage a space station capable of sustaining life for the countless minds trapped in your corrupted memory banks, and return to the fleet--by any means necessary. Starmancer offers gameplay with consequences, a living sandbox environment, crafting, and managing the daily lives of colonists. Create a utopian society where everyone is well fed, happy, and safe. Or go rogue and figure out how many times a colonist can eat wheat before they go crazy. The choice is yours! Sustain Life - Colonists have needs, like hunger and thirst. Build farms and grow crops for food. Place heaters to prevent hypothermia. Construct med bays and assign doctors to treat wounds, cure diseases, and replace limbs. Express Yourself - Customize your station with unique walling, floors, furniture, and tons of weird and wonderful decorations and objects. Repaint objects to achieve your space station interior design dreams! Place cheerful paintings to remind the colonists how friendly and relatable you are, and motivational posters to let them know how much you value their productivity. Design fancy kitchens, luxurious bedrooms, casinos, and industrial docking bays. Power, Water, and Atmosphere - Provide power by connecting machines with wires. Prepare against blackouts by creating separate or redundant grids for your vital machines. Use pipes and water recyclers to convert dirty farm water into clean, drinkable water. Establish separate atmospheres with the help of vents and air ducts. Grow Colonists - Colonists are grown in Incubators, with personas assigned from the minds of Earth refugees stored in memory banks on your station. Create stations full of clones. If tragedy strikes, don’t worry, you can always regrow your favorite colonists! Jobs - Assign roles like farmer, doctor, miner, and security guard. Watch as your rookie chef acquires experience and becomes a seasoned pro, unlocking tastier and more exotic recipes. Unique Colonists - With randomized hair color and style, eye color, and skin color, there are over 8000 visual variations of colonists. These variations go beyond aesthetics, too. Some colonists prefer eating nutrition bricks on the toilet, while others like to drink and socialize in the bar. Every game is different--your station and colonists will be unique to you. Memories - Colonists remember the good (and bad) things that happen to them - until they inevitably require regrowth (accidents happen). Traumatic experiences, like seeing a dead body, will be remembered for a long time. If left unchecked, these memories will be shared, through gossip, until everyone learns about your Life Support malfunction... Leave no witnesses. Personal Relationships - Colonists get extra sad when something bad happens to a friend, but they love to watch an enemy suffer. If you jettison a popular colonist you might have a mutiny on your hands. Missions - Send your bravest colonists on dangerous missions across the galaxy to gather resources and discover precious loot! Be ready to face the consequences, should you fail in your duties as a Starmancer. Invasion - Your colony will be invaded by creatures from outer space. Build traps, arm your colonists, and keep your station secure at all costs. Insanity - A colonist can only witness so many friends being sucked out of air locks before they snap. No one knows what motivates a crazy colonist; they're simultaneously responsible for the greatest technological innovations and messiest homicidal rampages. This is why doors have locks. It's also why you can depressurize a single room--a great way to enforce bedtime. Mutiny - Unhappy colonists will stop working. You can cheer them up with motivational posters, tasty treats, and nicer rooms. Be careful, though, when morale gets too low, colonists will actively rebel and attempt to destroy your core. Make an example out of rebels and stamp out any hint of resistance. Key Features Build a thriving space station, with tons of customization. Manage the lives of colonists aboard your station. Interact with a dynamically generated solar system and its inhabitants. Take on missions and be rewarded with loot. Face the consequences of your actions. Modding support.

1113090,Crown of the Empire,"Sep 7, 2020",0 - 20000,0,0,4.99,0,"The life of Elena, the first lady-in-waiting to Her Majesty, isn't so much about balls, corsets and fancy hats as it is court intrigue, secret service and life-threatening covert operations for the good of the Empire. For example, Elena's last mission was to safely recover stolen ancient relics. An unknown thief had ransacked the national museum and got away with the namesakes of the empire's oldest rulers. A team of detectives picked up a trail that led across the border, but then disappeared. The Queen summoned Elena. 'The items stolen are of paramount value to the empire and crown,' she said in a slightly wavering voice. 'We mustn't lose them.' 'I understand, your Majesty,' Elena answered. 'But announcing their disappearance would only complicate the matter, so you must carry out your duty in the strictest secrecy! You shall at once be sent abroad under the guise of an ambassador to carry out your investigation in secret. You must track down the perpetrator and force them to return what was stolen.' Elena soon found herself on a top-secret covert mission of vital interest to the Crown. Her first order of business upon arrival was notifying the local police of the missing valuables. 'Were the items stolen from your hotel or at the port?' Asked the chief of police, his moustache twitching like a walrus'. 'Neither,' Elena answered, 'they were stolen on the boat, but I know for certain the culprit is still here. 'Hm...very well,' the officer let out with an air of authority. 'We'll get on the case at once, don't you worry. There isn't a criminal out there who can slip away from me...' By evening, the list of suspects had been narrowed down to a few names. Elena asked the chief if she could accompany the detectives to identify the culprit, and he gave his permission. Elena was not only sharp as a tack, but was well-versed in the new deductive method, which had already helped her crack open five robbery cases, two murders and one case of destruction of hotel property. In the end, Elena and the detective team tracked down the artifact thief and were just waiting for the judge to sign the arrest warrant, when an urgent telegram came in from the Prime Minister with orders to meet that very night. She had no choice but to return home that very instant and put her operation on hold. What was it that happened in the palace that forced her to abandon her job and return immediately? Join Elena on an unforgettable adventure through an alternate Victorian world across the endless Emperor Desert Valley, the green banks of the Nile, a volcanic island and more! Will good conquer evil? Can Elena return the Crown of the Empire? Get ready for: - A unique alternate world full of wondrous machines and mysterious creations! - An intriguing plot full of mystical twists and covert secrets. - Vibrant graphics and fun animation. - Enjoy more than 40 exciting levels in 4 different locations. - 3 difficulty levels. - Helpful bonuses: work accelerators, production accelerators and movement accelerators. - Simple gameplay and easy-to-understand instructions. - More than 20 hours of exciting gameplay for any age. - Fun in-game music.

But you’re uneasy … this time feels so different. Long ago, you swore never to return here. And now, she has dragged you back. Your search leads deep into ancient Moravian forests and reveals secrets that should have stayed buried. While your survival skills and quick wits might advance your search, malevolent forces rise up against you. There are nightmares you can’t fight and win. Some of them … could be yours. Your character is Daniel, Stela’s father, who is forced by events to return to a place, he swore never to return. In the forest, he will encounter peculiar people who will help him understand the true reason why Stela keeps running away. Someday You’ll Return deals with intimate concepts of fatherhood, fears, lies, and refusal to accept one’s past. While the story contains strong horror elements it’s not always the most obvious monsters which are the most frightening. The story itself spans over 13+ hours, depending on your playstyle. GAMEPLAY Someday You’ll Return brings new bold ideas to the horror genre Psychological horror - Uncover dark mysteries of the ancient Czech forest and face your deepest fears Unique Crafting system - Use your head and think when crafting some of the useful tools of survival Herbalism and alchemy system - Find rare herbs and brew your own potions that will help you survive the nightmarish world of Someday You’ll Return Exploration - Explore lush forests, deep caverns, and old castles to find your daughter’s lost journal pages, folk songs, and rare collectibles.

While they are not exact duplicates, we desired to capture the atmosphere of Bohemian nature. There are well-known landmarks placed within the world, which you can discover and which we've personally visited many times in our lives. You can even grab your backpack and hike there. The referenced locations and mythos in the game are ancient. Some of the tales mentioned in Someday You’ll Return date back to the 9th century.","['English', 'Czech']","['English', 'Czech']","“Someday You'll Return is an immensely rewarding game with excellent visuals, world design, and storytelling.” 90 – PC Invasion “Someday You'll Return is an immersive game with stunning visuals, excellent storytelling and rich gameplay. And what I like most: the developers didn't try to reinvent the wheel. But instead took all the best parts from the genre and actually created something new. I’d go so far as to call it one of the best horror games from the last year.” 90 – Keen Gamer “Someday You’ll Return is much more than a psychological horror game, it’s an immersive adventure which you’ll never forget. Although initially looking for your daughter, you’ll soon find yourself helping others and discovering secrets about yourself and the past, things which you forgot a long time ago.” 85 – Game Pitt",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/840370/header.jpg?t=1593600992,http://www.youwillreturn.com,http://cbe-software.com/support/,support@cbe-software.com,True,False,False,66,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/someday-youll-return?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,505,80,,48,430,,0,0,0,0,CBE software,CBE software,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Indie","Adventure,Indie,Horror,Gore,Violent,First-Person,Psychological Horror,Great Soundtrack,Singleplayer,Exploration,Stealth,Narration,Nature,Crafting","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/840370/ss_12c66731947c66ea94830c7c5c1b13999b3eb477.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593600992,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/840370/ss_9ad787f44aadd5c0dffdd4970a6ef42861d3d6d3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593600992,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/840370/ss_8c5dc960529d56685eb15401758c99bff28118dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593600992,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/840370/ss_a08a989d14ff75bb6c0d7f97061c7b45a2235c19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593600992,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/840370/ss_61174c43635fcda888a6fce704d7d3e20e27158f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593600992,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/840370/ss_3b435cd526739190382719c39925f758ba3d587d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593600992,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/840370/ss_c241865ea3a8ad4cc97cc4eb84d5b0c86078c5fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593600992,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/840370/ss_0270c0f627772a0185b55f72d620a2a423ead294.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593600992,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/840370/ss_64cfe42a755d0e4f68200ed755c81518c693a964.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593600992,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/840370/ss_4ed29eb86253c923b757297eda0c16de03f34514.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593600992","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256774164/movie_max.mp4?t=1580806492,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256791258/movie_max.mp4?t=1593452015"

Your goal is simple; stay alive for as long as possible in a world literally falling apart. Since Streamline 1.0, there are now two gamemodes, 'Platform' and 'Dash'. Build your own designs in the new 'Builder' gamemode. Platform is our survival gamemode, survive for as long as you can whist your platform is falling appart. Use your powers to retract the cubes to their original position. Dash is our new gamemode where your objective is to capture the orbs and gain a score, also here the platform will fall apart. Use your powers to retract the cubes to their original position. Key features * Power: Use your power to retract the cubes to their original location. Power will be replenished over time. * Unpredictable Gameplay: The game is largely controlled by randomised events ensuring no two games will be the same. * Physics: Every cube has a mind of it's own and will calculate a path of it's own without the interference of other objects. * Gameplay: Movement system and colliders have been optimised for smooth gameplay where every touch of the player will calm the cubes motion.

1345280,Slide - Animal Race,"Feb 17, 2021",0 - 20000,0,0,12.99,1,"Play quick &amp; fun races with your friends. Ride cute animals through dreamy tracks and use bonuses to outrun the horde! Master the dive to avoid obstacles and gain boosts, and explore environments to find hidden shortcuts. Or just take a tour and enjoy the view, while listening to the sympho-ethnic soundtrack. That's up to you. FAMILY FRIENDLY MULTIPLAYER Play up to 8 players in local splitscreen! Steam 'Remote Play Together' is supported. The game is family friendly and offers some assistance for younger players or beginners. However, to fully master the game, you'll have to take advantage of all the controls the game offers. Easy to get, hard to master! DIVE TO BOOST At any time you can choose to dive under the track; this makes you drift but you gain boosts afterwards. The trick is, diving can also be done in a straight line. Use it wisely to outrun your opponents! But will you be able to handle this super speed? Diving is also useful to avoid bad stuff on the track. RIDE CUTE ANIMALS Who has never dreamt of riding wildlife animals ? Now you can choose among 6 cute animals. All animals have the same stats, so it's only a matter of personal taste. EVERLASTING BONUSES Find bonuses along the way to boost, protect yourself, or clutter the way of other players... But be careful, every trap will stay there until the end of the race. So try not to punish yourself! It can quickly become a mess and the last lap is often full of surprises. DREAMY TRACKS Tracks take place in oneiric worlds where nature is all around: clouds amongst auroras, snowy moutains, tropical islands or celtic lands... Some tracks are totally upside down, others are more peaceful and contemplative. All levels offer hidden shortcuts that you'll have to discover to gain precious seconds. ABOUT THE DEVELOPER Hi there! I'm Mathias and I've been creating video games since I was a child. I love science, playing music and drawing. So what's better than creating a video game to do all of this at the same time? I do everything alone because I love every part of it and I'm a curious guy who likes to know how it works!

It is based on the PS Vita version of the game. Below is a description of the entire trilogy. Easy to play, difficult to master, the Umihara Kawase Trilogy is a collection of three physics-based puzzle/platformer games with over 20 years of gaming history. Developed by the creators of the original game (Kiyoshi Sakai and Toshinobu Kondo), this cult classic was a Japanese indie smash hit! Umihara Kawase is the name of our backpacking, Japanese, sushi chef heroine armed with a fishing rod, elastic fishing line, and a fishing hook. Face fish-like enemies, conveyor belts, spikes, watery pits, time travel and more. Collect items, and find your way to the end of each level. The deeper into this dream-like world that you venture, the more challenging the solutions and the greater the time pressure becomes. Along the way, look out for shortcuts and secret exits, and unlock bonus levels. The elasticity of Umihara’s fishing line sets the Umihara Kawase Trilogy apart from other games, giving unprecedented levels of mobility and discovery. Tightening the line or giving lots of slack can be the difference between success or failure. The elastic nature of the fishing line allows the player to stretch down to otherwise unreachable areas or be catapulted upwards. Trilogy Features Physics-based puzzle/platforming that challenges your reflexes and brainpower Extreme elastic fishing-line physics give you advanced control Many stages with branching paths across three complete games Steam Workshop support in all three games for sharing replays Four playable characters (in Sayonara Umihara Kawase) Face giant, aquatic bosses like a tadpole, a seahorse, and more Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Leaderboards, and Cloud Saving Full Steam controller support for all three games (optional)","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian']",[],“Sayonara Umihara Kawase es prácticamente la primera oportunidad que Occidente ha tenido para probar un juego de culto que marcó época desde la escena proto-indie japonesa y que sin duda es el mejor juego de grappling y física elástica jamás hecho.” 8.5 – Level up,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378750/header.jpg?t=1657782247,http://www.degica.com,,games@komodo.com,True,False,False,0,,0,128,8,,30,123,,0,0,0,0,Studio Saizensen,Komodo,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Indie","Action,Indie,Physics,Precision Platformer,Anime,2.5D,Female Protagonist,Platformer,Difficult,Puzzle-Platformer,Cute,VR","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378750/ss_374a24ad2ab10262dfa42194ace37648c2d0b826.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657782247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378750/ss_ec663d46ec8cc9e7340b13122db718650f32ba43.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657782247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378750/ss_80e2ca3c9d059a10081030e2c8fbd135da41568b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657782247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378750/ss_da16cd22a610fc9051547b0a87315dceaca7046b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657782247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378750/ss_005c542e6673b0334c9ff87cc53fd2afa5d3a1ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657782247",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256655838/movie_max.mp4?t=1447377666

680930,Fairy Lands: Rinka and the Fairy Gems,"Aug 25, 2017",0 - 20000,1,0,2.3,0,"Weird gems are falling from the skies! Who will manage to do something about it? Maybe Rinka? Well, Wiseghaika surely hopes that somebody will do something. Some fairies managed to learn how to use them as a weapon, so fights will be less painful. But not all of them have mastered this art. To be exact - neither of our six heroes can use those mysterious stones in big barrages. This... might give you some problems. But c'mon, since when were heroes stronger that their foes? (Please, don't say it in front of Skootis.) Back to gems! Weird thing about them - when two of the same color collide, they go 'ding' and release some weird spheres. Those spheres can absorb other gems! Red spheres, for example, absorb all red gems, they meet, but will stop after absorbing any gem that isn't red. The same happens with others, mostly-maybe! ('^' ) If gems will touch left side of your screen, you'll get hurt! Does it makes sense? What are 'screens'? I heard abut them from Astro-fairies, but now they are extinct, so I can't ask them. Gray gems are different and weird! They won't hurt you and most likely will disappear after touching that weird shield in front of you. It is almost like they're devoid of energy. But you shouldn't take them too easy - You can't destroy them as there are no gray gems in your arsenal, so, only way is either to wait while they will be destroyed by the barrier, or make some sphere touch them. =about the Game Itself= This game is made in the vein of old puzzle-like games, without real twist. Just simple active puzzle.Or maybe there is some twist? For the first game made with this engine I think it is good job from my side, considering, that everything except music is made by sole silly me. Now, there is a couple known bugs that can occur, but won't destroy game too much, or maybe they are finally gone - couldn't get them last beta-testing session. Game just... likes to be important to you, so please remember to put it on a pause, if you suddenly need to do something else, while playing. ('^' ) Please, tell us about bugs, we'll be trying to fix them. Remember to save settings in OPTIONS, or else when you restart the game they'll go back to standard ones. Markiza Info-fairy - Young individual composed of only two things - information and desire to obtain new information. Sersh Tech-fairy - Lone wanderer, aimlessly pondering around Fairy Lands. Also he often loses his hand, so it is hidden in his pocket most of time. Roxanna Rag-fairy - Little silly girl with a big melodic dream. She is soft to the touch too. Volia Aqua-fairy - Self-confident boy made of magical clay who possesses ability to control water. He is water. He is sane. He loves to eat. Skootis Ash-fairy - She will be the strongest, you hear me? This is for sure is not her writings! But it is truth! Rinka Barbarian-fairy - This girl surely loves marzipan cakes. And to crush stuff when cake goes not into her belly. And hey, she is important!

Each player can play thru all lanes at once, switch every 1 lane, every 3 lanes, etc. Multiplayer scoreboards available on all lanes Standard Mode: The newest game mode! Use powerups to boost your game and try to get the highest score possible! No Powerups Mode: Normal bowling rules apply, and no powerups are available. Try to get the highest score possible!

Knock down all of the pins as quickly as possible! You get unlimited throws in this mode so fire away! Normal Bowling Mode: Feel like changing it up and playing a regular game of bowling? You can!

900010,Meeple Station,"Apr 10, 2020",20000 - 50000,5,0,19.99,1,"So What Is Meeple Station? Meeple Station is an isometric pixel-art space station building and management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee! Meeple need things to live! Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food! Make sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station. Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining! Meeple Station boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors- so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire. Trade! At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update, we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system, you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different planets. Fight off lazy pirates! Pirates gonna pirate. Maybe they did bad in school and space is hard? Whatever the reason, they want your stuff. That's waaaay easier than doing work themselves. Make sure you have guard Meeple to fight them when they come. Station shields and turrets work wonders against bombers. We have so many big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly to try to get them in your hands as soon as humanly possible, because we're over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network.

Although Hermes is a clever and mischievous god, his fate actually rests in the hands of the player.

She's wandered out onto a plank at the top of the crane and is oblivious to the peril she's in.

363360,Interstellar Rift,"Sep 24, 2020",50000 - 100000,25,0,6.79,2,"Interstellar Rift is an open world Starship Simulator with an emphasis on ship construction and multi-player interaction. Players can explore and conquer the galaxy with their own custom designed and constructed starship. Space is vast, but you don’t have to face it alone, other players will be able to join your crew, and help out, or build their own rival fleet and fight you across the galaxy. Prepare to make these custom built spaceships your home when exploring the galaxy! Use the ship editor to design a ship to your liking, from small exploratory vessels to large cargo haulers, or even enormous battleships. With the editor you build your ship deck by deck, inside and outside. If you'd rather get going immediately you can always browse the workshop for ships that other players made, or you can upload your own blueprints. The galaxy can be a dangerous place, even when playing solo. Strange rifts have opened up, unleashing a hostile race of alien creatures called the Skrill. If left unchecked, they will take over solar systems wreaking havoc on your enterprising. You can fight them alone, or call in the help of your friends, and man a ship together. But not all pilots will fight for a good cause, pirates and opposing fleets can come after you and your cargo at any time. Fight them ship versus ship, or hack your way aboard their vessels and bring the fight to them, in close quarters shootouts. The economy of Interstellar Rift runs on the resources that can be gathered out in the galaxy. Vast asteroid belts circle planets and solar systems, filled with precious ores and minerals. Start up your resource extractors, or send out a wave of mining drones to do the hard labour for you. Visit the stores of LogiCorp and Galactic Trade, or drive a hard bargain with stranded pilots as you delive them fuel. Automate production lines with the ACTR (automated cargo transfer relay), and set up your own store to trade with other players, or any trade drones that might be nearby. After choosing a faction to ally with, the galaxy is open for you to explore. Use rift generators to open up spatial rifts that transport you to new systems, exploring a system will help you map out the galaxy, and pinpoint the location of systems with special resources you might need. Construct new trade posts for the companies and factions that want to expand their influence, and help them set up secure stations and sectors. Take on missions for U-nits, or find good deals across multiple systems to make a profit from.","['English', 'German', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'French', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/header.jpg?t=1608771955,https://www.interstellarrift.com/,https://www.interstellarrift.com/contact-2/,info@split-polygon.com,True,False,False,0,,0,1041,414,,42,1231,,1141,0,1588,0,Split Polygon,Iceberg Interactive,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,LAN Co-op,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop,Includes level editor","Action,Indie,Simulation","Space Sim,Open World,Building,Exploration,Crafting,Sandbox,PvP,Mining,Survival,First-Person,Trading,Space,3D,Action,Simulation,Sci-fi,Atmospheric,Futuristic,Adventure,Aliens","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_7c086f7ed1b87218b9132e71a08ea71368e259d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_3be5d48d963e0b77dedb054486774acdc18b9c43.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_717b93a6da7564c2738019ec45e1f03852eaf90c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_33ac4b7b4d734e5f7b16f512d5595829e200d76e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_59a47b89909bc3445b42fcbfb70b73a6e234c65c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_9923d10595779ce905db8edac0422f7b5a3b6184.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_e9db69af5d149d897c93f8dd2ab62f2c371730bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_f6d13e7404829f7a12c40d6e4271ddbd3e254b12.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_dc90a26b9ce9c8e7eb49882b5e071ecf558cc53d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_51f2d57e19807076cf9b838fd1aa50968adb7d42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_2a1ace2ddeb95855d7ef2ade20dd013d97dcbc38.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_7b174a44d2701830f718daf407245baabbccbe73.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_98aaf2afacff36c9b8704a154dc659cee9c17365.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_fd048f5a932a908d97a9f20642614c84c1928dfa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_7423a02133fd267efac80c7af4e078fb8ee95726.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_65616aed3ce8b0dbe149e78fbeae24340b4145a0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_5a23a6e0163366f859cf171b123ed3ed529e0e77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_8d6cb74dd05f1b635207cc41935ac8147d8defb0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_60fa6e30151c02538d2925bba17ac45fee6572e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363360/ss_07c04c8b5f4415259de529da0ab797a54b0d9981.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608771955","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256799073/movie_max.mp4?t=1598725776,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256779610/movie_max.mp4?t=1599049607,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256704434/movie_max.mp4?t=1513969109,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256669326/movie_max.mp4?t=1471893280"

388440,Big Journey to Home,"Aug 20, 2015",20000 - 50000,0,0,2.99,2,"Welcome to the world of adventures!   You play as Jake, a simple guy who accidently got into trouble. What will happen to him, how he will behave, will he get home or not, all that depends on you. You will encounter a variety of creatures along your way, from roaches to huge scorpions, lizards and even small hamsters! Apart from living beings, you will see a variety of complex mechanisms. To overcome snow, forests, deserts and underground areas, you will require a good weapon. Though you already have that - a well-sharpened blade that will slice (almost) every monster. The game requires you to plan every step, so that monsters won't have you for dinner. However, if you stand still, the monsters won't touch you. The 'Hardcore' mode won't let you sleep, though, it will require your full attention. If a friend of yours keeps bothering you, you can play a separate story about Jake and his brother together. You can walk through the same far-away places and see the same monsters, however, they will behave differently. If your friend gets lost, you will be able to show him where to go using the built-in chat and marker. The game has an achievement system - try to unlock them all! If you want to stay in this unusual world, you can extend the fun with usermade levels that people just like you can build. Thanks to the convenient level download system, you won't be leaving the game for a long time.   A brief history of development   The game was developed for the duration of five years, gradually improving. Different people contributed to the game and the development team changed over time. Some people worked on level design, some others did art. As of right now, the game has only one developer left: Vyacheslav 'Silver Sword' Mironov. I have started this game and I have led it to its release.   Key features of the game   Learn how Jake ended up in the forest and help him back home Travel through dark forests, undergrounds, cold ice caves and hot deserts!

According to the legend, the Old Gods withdraw to those islands, casting spells of oblivion and serenity on them. The chief editor of a well-known newspaper made me an unusual offer. He promised to reward me for bringing photographs of one of those peculiar islands and the God resting there. A strange offer, to say the least. One I could not refuse however: at that time, creditors were incessantly banging at my door. When they threatened to seize my beloved airship to pay off the debts, I didn’t think twice and immediately left on my quest. Pocket Kingdom is an authentic throwback to Amiga era. Signature steampunk pixel art, winsome chiptune soundtrack and retro-inspired gameplay with modern twists make Pocket Kingdom an unparalleled journey. Wander around the island's enchanted districts. Unlock access to new areas by collecting objects scattered here and there. Trick gravity, discover helpful devices and listen to the weird stories told by the locals.

922880,Siberian Dawn,"Sep 20, 2018",0 - 20000,0,0,4.99,2,"More Than Just Another Deckbuilder... Road To 5.0 We are currently on the road to Siberian Dawn 5.0, working on a number of significant additions to improve the presentation of the game, and the latest update 4.6 brings the latest additions made on this journey so far over the last few months with 3 new training missions added to the base game. So currently in the game you can play a set of 4 interactive Tutorials and 4 Training Missions, but there is still much more content to be added before 5.0 and listed below you will see the content still to come. Mission packs 1 and 2 also currently each give you 3 full missions of the Siberian Dawn story. - A set of Missions comparable to the Missions in the Mission Packs, set before the Siberian Dawn story - Skirmish mode with the new content of the Base game, DLC will then add extra content to this mode - Crisis mode with the new content of the Base game, DLC will then add extra content to this mode - Ark section that will contain various unlocks and uncover the secrets of Siberian Dawn This game is a strategic card based wargame with deckbuilding elements and the detailed tutorials will take you through how to play the game. As it was built to be a game that offered a lot of strategic options during a mission it is not a simple deckbuilder but is a game that requires thought and a bit of time to learn its mechanics. Overview Siberian Dawn is an original, solo, digital card game that combines the core soul of a deck builder with the tactical power of a war game and the strategic challenge of crisis management. You are an Overseer in the Union, one of the tactical controllers who has to deal with the increasing dangers facing the Union through Objective based Missions. Recruit and deploy Units, enlist the help of the Guilds, and build your Bond with those in the shadows, whilst trying to control the conflict unfolding before you. The base game contains a detailed series of interactive tutorials and 4 Training Mission that will teach you how to play the game, and the Mission Packs available as DLC each add 3 new Missions of the Siberian Dawn story. The World In Siberian Dawn you play the part of an Overseer in the Union, an industrial state covering what we know as Europe. Overseers are the tactical experts of the Union and responsible for quickly dealing with troubles as they arise using a limited resource pool, controlled squad level force, and possible support from the Guilds. Siberian Dawn has a heavy character driven setting, in a gritty near future military world that mixes in medieval and supernatural horror elements to the theme. The game starts as hostility has been growing in Industrial Habit IH-54 of the Eastern Zones for the last few weeks. Outcasts are rumoured to have been stirring up this dissent and it is believed they are connected to a cult called the Dawn, Overseers have been assigned to deal with this unrest and you are one of them. Each Mission will give the Overseer a series of Objectives to complete which have variety and offer the Overseer different challenges during the Mission. Missions will be playable individually but also form a narrative story as the Overseer uncovers the truth of the Dawn and how deep secrets go within the Union and Guilds. Mission Example An example Training mission in the base game is First Run, which is aimed to give you a taste of Siberian Dawn and the basics of a Mission. The Objectives in this Mission will take you through the steps towards the final Objective to kill the 4 VBots, the Missions in Mission Pack 1 and those to follow will contain multiple Objectives offering a longer more challenging game. First Run also contains 2 Units, the Grunt and the Scribe. The Grunt is your basic Union military Unit that will be used to attack the VBots, and the Scribe is a Guild support Unit who will help you gain Glory. Full Missions add 18 new Units to these 2 basic ones. Lore Engine Siberian Dawn is the first game to use the Lore Deck Building Engine, taking the core of a Deck Builder and adding the depth of a War Game to give the player a more strategic challenge. Dual Deck Development – Build a Resource deck and Tactics deck. Bond System – Adds 1 of 4 Guild specific contacts in a Mission (Available with Mission Pack 1) Hub System – Context relevant controls presented on a central set of pods. Fate Helix – Action resolution using a deck system allowing control over the risk of the results. Multiple Resource Management – Overseer has to balance a range of Resources to succeed.

It features all the intensity, depth, and lovingly handcrafted pixels of a classic arcade shooter, with a modern twist: deeply-integrated cooperative gameplay. Unlike most top-down shooters, which give multiple players a shared pool of lives or continues, Jamestown does something different.

It's simple: build your ship and blast everything that comes your way. Wrack up points as you go and keep the Graps (future space money) earned from everything you destroy. The more Graps you make, the better you can equip your next ship, and the better chance you'll stand of lasting longer in the pit. The goal? Set the high score and become champion of the Star-Pit! This is my first attempt at making this style of game, and I sincerely hope it provides you plenty of entertainment. If you encounter any issues along the way or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or through my website. I'm always looking for feedback so I can improve, so don't hesitate to reach out! Thanks for checking out the game, and good luck in the pit! Matthew Milson - Puddledock Games Starships are made up of individual components called 'Star-Chips'. They are the guts of the ship: thrusters, laser guns, shields, etc. They can be placed in whatever arrangement you want. Once your ship is designed, you are placed in the Star-Pit to battle enemy starships and put your creation to the ultimate test. As chips on the ship are destroyed, the ship loses whatever functionality they provided. Earn points and Graps for destroying enemies starships chip-by-chip and spend those hard earned funds on your next starship. Enemy ships get increasingly more difficult the longer you last in the pit. Also there's space mines. Watch out for those.

Meanwhile, a deadly plague has broken out on Cerberus and is spreading quickly. The Astral Corps has a vaccine en route from another star system, but the local population has to be convinced to accept the vaccine when it arrives. Will you be able to put down the rebellion? Will the locals accept your bid to ensure their safety? When you find yourself separated from the rest of the Hoplite platoons and harried by rebel forces, how will you survive in the Cerberan landscape? Play as male, female, or non-binary; straight, gay or bi. Find romance with your commander, a fellow platoon leader, a Fifth Platoon pilot, or one the troopers in your command. Hunt down rebels, infiltrating and destroying their base, or use diplomacy to broker with them peacefully. Face the notorious Major Zhang, holding his life and the rebels’ fate in your hands. Crush the rebel presence on Cerberus, or join their cause and betray the Astral Corps’ mission. Convince the colonists to accept the Astral Corps vaccine, or leave the colonists of Free Lhasa of their fate. You’re fresh out of battle school with a lot to prove. Will you win hearts and minds, or grind this planet to dust?",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1069820/header.jpg?t=1556300672,https://www.choiceofgames.com/,https://www.choiceofgames.com/contact-us/,support-fogofwar-steam@choiceofgames.com,True,True,True,0,,0,7,3,,17,0,,0,0,0,0,Choice of Games,Choice of Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Adventure,Indie,RPG,Text-Based,Choose Your Own Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1069820/ss_c7bb310186d12031bad8d54c8bc65b2f81ac377b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556300672,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1069820/ss_6e2d4e165c1f946698fe90f662987dfb4b5128b9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556300672,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1069820/ss_fdf0374f23c1a9483cfb8a35fb50b455a72b5aee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556300672,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1069820/ss_3f3ae37adc1c2dcd357f11a1183ada3d34905914.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556300672,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1069820/ss_53ae9767cb88661a91eb37368ad69363f0882f6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556300672",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256748050/movie_max.mp4?t=1556298964

Last Stop is a single-player third-person adventure set in present day London. Written and developed by Variable State, creators of the award-winning Virginia, Last Stop tells three interconnected tales featuring three playable main characters. - Donna, a spaced-out high-schooler who feels trapped by her stifling home life and her overprotective big sister. Away from home, Donna seeks teenage thrills with her friends Becky and Vivek, but gets more than she bargained for when the trio become unexpected kidnappers in a game of amateur detective gone wrong. - John, an overworked middle-aged single dad. Burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent, John jealously pines after the free and easy life of his twenty-something bachelor neighbour, Jack. When the pair unwittingly fall foul of a vengeful stranger, a cursed artefact threatens to transform their lives forever. - Meena, a ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work. As Meena vies with an upstart colleague for a crucial promotion, something ancient stirs in the basement beneath her workplace. Last Stop is fully voice acted, featuring hours of dialogue and a voice cast of dozens, with performances from some of the brightest talent in the UK today, including rising star Lulu Simpson as Molly Smith. Last Stop features an original soundtrack by BAFTA award winning composer Lyndon Holland, performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Roleplay as 3 unique characters.

1457840,Fishticuffs,"Dec 21, 2020",0 - 20000,0,0,4.99,0,"Fishticuffs is a bullet hell fishing roguelite. You cast your hook into the ocean in order to harvest fish and treasure. But the fish are not bassic creatures, they will not be harvested withtrout putting up a fight. As a wise man once said: 'The best defense is a lot of bullets'. Looking at the behaviour of the fish, they seem to have writ this quote into the very bedrock of their culture, if their determination to krill you is any indication. Whale you descend through each level you have the opportunity to swell your coffers like a pufferfish, by grabbing treasure and harvesting fish. But of course this must be considered against the risk of damage that may be inherent to attacking these aquatic adversaries and seeking these submurged shinies. Maybe it is best to battle anemone for monetary reward. Or perhaps it is a difficult situation beyond your equipment that you should not fall for: hook, line or sinker. Among the underwater world are items for you to find and wield. Some of them you will find offered up to you for free on a silver platter as though you're not a fisherman but a nobleman in an esteemed restaurant. Others will require payment, for there are some in this world who understand that everything is worth some fee. As your skill waxes you will find ways to coral ever more items into your item purse, amassing an uncodly amount of power. If your hook is slain, the voyage begins anew, with nothing taken from one run to the next other than your own expertise and knowledge. Your mind attunad to the ways of the game, learning how to maximise your power and wealth via items, how to skate around the bullets of the fish to stay unharmed. Different enemy patterns and items will appear on each run, so your ability to improvise will be tried. Some of these items are simplistic such as shark blades that grant you more damage, and a wrench that repairs your hook. Others are more complex like a parasite that causes some fish to explode into homing fisshiles, and a 'gun bender' that causes fish to sometimes accidentally shoot themselves. Most items will stack if you collect more than one, so hoarding fifty knives will kill most fish in one hit, and fifty gun benders will almost guarantee fish to self-shoot. To start a run from death takes mere seconds. You may die, and before you know it you'll be able to clam an item on the next run and be bonking fish left right and centre. In only a few minutes you'll know the flavour of the run: Whether it is characterised by an abundance of friendly fisshiles blowfishing up everything within line of sight; or swimming in so much health and self-repair that the idea of your mortality is a red herring; or enough treasure and wealth that when you retire you can ignore goldfish and buy a platinumfish instead. Shortly after you'll have a verdict on whether you win or lose the run, normally you won't take fifteen minutes from beginning to end.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1457840/header.jpg?t=1640077091,http://yokcos.co.uk/fishticuffs/,http://steamcommunity.com/app/1457840,,True,False,False,0,,0,11,0,,7,0,,0,0,0,0,Yokcos,Yokcos,"Single-player,Partial Controller Support","Action,Indie","Bullet Hell,Fishing,Rogue-like,Arcade,Funny,Action,Action Roguelike,Stylized,Pixel Graphics,Rogue-lite,Underwater,Perma Death,Indie,Score Attack,2D,Singleplayer,Retro","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1457840/ss_973da5a934132e2e638eb3ac30562135c576b573.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640077091,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1457840/ss_7b817edec8a732119b6daf15e8381c3e5d553661.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640077091,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1457840/ss_0fc73e13d44307ad3f5dd6003c6705a62a348a27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640077091,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1457840/ss_5d7d81d1656d9ca5a32ba384e75ea739ab1d081f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640077091,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1457840/ss_b224029b8ea6dd529d45a563ef52c51ebe405917.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640077091,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1457840/ss_c1437c24a6bae1d3e0d5dd6cb45731a0f1cc0f56.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640077091","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256866041/movie_max.mp4?t=1640077089,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256808005/movie_max.mp4?t=1604468650"

Fight your friends in this fast-paced and strategic game! And fear not, for the lone wolves out there we have a boss-rush styled singleplayer mode, battling your way through 7 uniquely designed and challenging bosses! Multiplayer Multiplayer is the core element of Hexvade, as what is more fun than having your hard work destroyed by a friend, and then getting to smash them in the head with bricks later on? The concept is simple: one player plays as the Dropper and the other as the Dodger. The Dropper must align pieces to create lines in order to make the Dodger vulnerable to hazards. The Dodger must sabotage the game board using a plethora of items and abilities, and dodge their way around pieces when the Dropper manages to create a line. Game ends if the Dodger is killed or trapped, or if the Dropper fails to clear pieces and they get stacked too high. If the timer runs out, the victory goes to the Dodger for being able to survive the onslaught. With 8 Dropper and 8 Dodger characters, each with their own passive and active ablities as well as a wide range of items, there's never a dull moment! Singleplayer Should you find yourself alone one rainy day and have a hankering for hexagonal-based destruction, there is a singleplayer mode for you try your hand at! Fight your way through 7 unique and challenging bosses and get awarded points for speed, accuracy, and control! These points will unlock new characters for Multiplayer, and you also get to brag online that you're 3 frames faster at beating a boss than someone else!

763890,Wildermyth,"Jun 15, 2021",200000 - 500000,685,0,24.99,0,"Wildermyth is a character-driven, procedurally-generated tactical RPG. Like the best tabletop roleplaying experiences, Wildermyth gives you choices and answers your every decision with consequences that drive your characters forward. Lead a band of heroes as they grow from reluctant farmers into unique, legendary fighters. Combat unexpected threats and strange monsters across interactive battlefields. Unravel mysteries and share pensive moments in an ever-new fantasy setting that blends hard truths and sacrifice with humor and personal storytelling. Where does your myth lead? Come help us uncover it! Reminiscent of tabletop roleplaying, unique heroes are born in unique settings every game. They age, transform, fall in love, disagree, and make harrowing sacrifices. Each hero brings their own organic history and personality with them, but your choices and combat skills are what decide their paths and outcomes. All heroes die someday… but you get to hold on to your favorites. Reintroduce them in the next adventure, and over many lifetimes the myths you make will form your own legendary pantheon. An Imaginative Papercraft World The Yondering Lands, where the game is set, is a richly layered world populated with hand-painted 2D characters and scenery. We’ve paid loving attention to breaking molds and exploring new ideas: no orcs, elves, or goblins here—but watch out for the telepathic insect-dragons and the clockwork undead. Extreme Character Depth Each of your heroes has their own unique generated history, personality, and appearance, and will form relationships with your other heroes. All of these elements change and develop over the course of a playthrough, as characters age, encounter mysteries, and overcome challenges. Choices That Matter Your hero may choose to trust the enigmatic wolf god, leading to a hair-raising change in their appearance and combat abilities. Or they may pursue a romance with a fellow hero, giving each of them a shared buff and more story opportunities. Encounters and events have permanent, character-defining effects, letting you craft the arc of each character. A New Approach to Death Did your favorite character get one-shotted by a tentacled horror-bear? Choose to let a hero 'fall back' with a maiming that will lead to some transformative new paths in their legend, or let them go out in a blaze of glory to be remembered for generations to come. Deep and Creative Tactical Combat Combat in Wildermyth emphasizes teamwork and careful positioning, as well as imaginative use of your evolving capabilities and surroundings. Walling and Flanking mechanics provide clear but conflicting incentives, while mystical interfusion lets you remake the battlefield with explosive magic. Multiple difficulty levels mean you can get as intense as you want to. Cooperative Multiplayer In a multiplayer game, you and your friends can each customize and control your own heroes as you play through a campaign. Recommended for up to five players—though in a typical campaign, you start with three heroes and pick up the fourth and fifth along the way. We also support Steam Remote Play. Endless Replayability Pick and choose from a huge bank of combat abilities as your heroes level up in each playthrough, and decide whether you prefer offensive or defensive tactics, brute strength, stealth, or magically flinging fire from a nearby lamp into your enemies' faces. Procedural generation gives you new heroes, new enemies, new story events, and new maps every time you play. A Custom Pantheon of Legends You’ll have the freedom to customize hero appearances, names, histories, and more. As time passes, heroes grow old and may retire, or else might fall in combat—and yes, some will survive all the way to the end. You can add your favorite heroes to a roster of legends and call on them again in later playthroughs. Build your own mythologies and share the awe-inspiring might of your heroes with others.","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",[],"“Witty writing, evocative art and engrossing battles combine in a wonderful homage to classic tabletop games.” The Guardian “Indie RPG Wildermyth aims to combine the best of storytelling with the best of procedural generation and succeeds, thanks to great writing, solid tactics, and some very clever design decisions.” IGN “A legend-building RPG that deserves to define the next decade.” PC Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763890/header.jpg?t=1649344695,http://wildermyth.com,https://wildermyth.com/wiki/index.php?title=Technical_Difficulties,support@worldwalkergames.com,True,True,True,87,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/wildermyth?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,12399,637,,56,11988,,649,439,359,439,Worldwalker Games LLC,"Worldwalker Games LLC,WhisperGames","Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Online Co-op,LAN Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Workshop,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Includes level editor,Remote Play Together","Indie,RPG,Strategy","Party-Based RPG,Story Rich,Choices Matter,Turn-Based Tactics,Character Customization,Procedural Generation,Fantasy,Tactical RPG,Hand-drawn,Turn-Based Strategy,Rogue-lite,Emotional,RPG,Comic Book,Turn-Based,Moddable,Indie,Strategy,Singleplayer,2.5D","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763890/ss_3a550445bd69fcd8df3b57227ddac57502407fad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649344695,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763890/ss_f5a6c358f0ce9366cd5372c2049fda4370085ede.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649344695,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763890/ss_13cb73afe38d7d0961360cc7ffe646fec2ab176b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649344695,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763890/ss_b717225f5e9a43e98b885c12b448f0c94f7e6374.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649344695,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763890/ss_d61392e1b74ec8c7a2d0d7515c2dc3f236961808.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649344695,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763890/ss_42cd194e73bcf9653af5c78aa4f5577c013dc8e0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649344695,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763890/ss_53f4116a77a7bd57778769897c535b1747b9e6a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649344695,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763890/ss_e81e1512acd50b1e912b44698646b82269982968.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649344695,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763890/ss_45986d9ef604ea2977d0f2d11d25e7f0d391a4b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649344695","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256839047/movie_max.mp4?t=1623807106,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256764731/movie_max.mp4?t=1623775777,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256702547/movie_max.mp4?t=1516122506"

581660,Super Meat Boy Forever,"Jan 10, 2022",20000 - 50000,4,0,19.99,1,"The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever! This time around Meat Boy is always running, like literally...it's an auto-runner . He can't stop and he won't stop. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds. What’s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. We created over 6000 level chunks and smash them together to create new unique levels and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We’ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production. Super Meat Boy Forever takes place a few years after the events of Super Meat Boy. Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Dutch', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/header.jpg?t=1641929185,http://www.supermeatboy.com,http://support.supermeatboy.com,support@supermeatboy.com,True,False,False,70,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/super-meat-boy-forever?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,295,289,,36,500,,29,0,29,0,Team Meat,Team Meat,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on TV","Action,Adventure,Indie","Indie,Action,Precision Platformer,Platformer,Difficult,Runner,Singleplayer,2D,Violent,Side Scroller,Colorful,Gore,Family Friendly,Hack and Slash,Adventure,Funny,2D Platformer,War,Dark Comedy,Blood","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_f9016c9691c4321668672010a4b1810b7b6c5f77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_516efa224aa2f663b75d860f9b33c0f1b4afdf2c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_dfd4b266f07b7dd5a5ac120a4829283c16c9758e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_02280ef1945a7cb152736810a5aff04b15068a79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_43864dbd01175942b5aef71bbfaaa8a3d91563ea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_959dfabfba7dd5c01bad73b18c1b109d802bbf22.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_3da20270cf4fab49700f833a1a398f194d444364.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_8b11ddd470f25f1a0938c0e0eab6ea533ed573bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_e79468682cf462ddf411a2fa519261cf4cc91304.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_47bb4e5d8ee3d0283ce298b79f22fb84a46620fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_8ebe131c88f89b2803c30b5247ed8b5a2a6c8783.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_0b4cd9076aa97e70ae4f63ca8ee1265b21d11c66.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_2270387d0c7a1ae06b2379826e7189b48aa757c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_ee7919fc97b0d45d11ab18d43b526cb328e06014.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_1edef21ec2d6baa762ad17d48bd63c53c76a6cd7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_9065f87a9153e248625fd77d8d843f53b2596040.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_ae507f0d501cb382106da272d841625ec3b4eaa6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/581660/ss_93516a2fe88f389d99114c4ee99fe03d2e50810d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641929185",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256868402/movie_max.mp4?t=1641786618

Play as either a Friend- a skeleton warrior assembled of bones from a mass grave; or a Cursed One- the fleshy walking Corpse of an embalmed aristocrat.

You wake with a voice whispering in your head, leading you ahead on a quest of knowledge and power. Venture outward and explore the ever expanding Realm of the Dead. You must settle the land and build a new home as you wander the desert in search of pages of an old book, The Lore, which may hold the key to salvation. Participate in First-Person open-world PvP and PvE combat, as well as recurring daily events. Craft spells and magic trinkets to gear up in a completely customizable loadout. Throw fireballs, create giant sandstorms, hurl meteors and glide from the highest peaks with your spellcasting powers. Build a base with free-placing gigantic stone monoliths. Make your own Stonehenge and live in it. Place a Throne and establish a community to gain benefits from being a good neighbor. Make new friends and skeleton dance together, or insult each other with animated emotes. Animyst has been in open, playable, development since 2018 and is made by a tiny team of two mortals.

No rogue elements, no random content, everything is handcrafted and deliberately designed. Backtracking is not a dirty word. Based on the comic book of the same name, BioMech casts you as Tatiana Rocheva , a Russian soldier who served her country in Iraq. After being captured and tortured, she was outfitted with enhanced cybernetic limbs giving her inhuman strength and speed. Now, Tatiana is being sent on her most dangerous mission yet! Satellites picked up signals coming from an uninhabited area deep within the Siberian forest. Analysis suggests the presence of a secret weapons facility run by the enemy. No signs of human life have been detected. Either the site is abandoned or it is completely automated. Your mission is to infiltrate the facility, find out its purpose and destroy any and all technology you deem unsafe. Features: Classic Metroid-like gameplay Handcrafted, interconnected maps Grow stronger with mandatory and optional upgrades Carefully balanced boss fights Bridging the gap between retro and modern Non-linear story progression No rogue-like elements, no random content Multiple endings ------------------------------- Controller Information: This game is compatible with a wide range of gamepads.

Story You play as Frigg, a young carpenter trading their busy life in the city for an apprenticeship in a small town. When she arrives in Elk, Frigg worries that the slower pace of life will be boring (they don’t even have the internet), but quickly discovers nothing could be further from the truth! Tragic stories told with love and sometimes humour The stories reflect the drama of our lives, on Elk it’s known that humour, love and death go hand in hand. Life may seem hard sometimes, but it is always followed by laughter. Make new friends On Elk, you will meet weird and wonderful characters - people whom the world has either ignored or forgotten. Follow their ups and downs, their odd drinking rituals and their unique ways of tackling whatever life throws at them. Unique mini games Help your new friends on Elk through playful mini games. All games are uniquely tailored to underline the story and the mood of the game. Meet the people who told the original stories We value the importance of storytellers, those who carry the tales of others and share them. That's why, in Elk, you will also meet the living storytellers who inspired us to make this game. How we used true stories in the game? True stories? how to use a true story in an ethical way? This is how we have dealt with it in Welcome to Elk: The stories in Welcome to Elk, are told by the people who we know and/or were there when the events took place. All are told from memory. The way they are used both on our webpage and in the game is true to the core story but everything like names, locations and other details are changed, renamed and often re-framed to protect the real people behind them, therefore, we call them tall tales. The stories are not one to one like you would experience in true crime for example. They are rewritten and combined to one linear narrative. Characters may play a role in one story where they where not a part of originally and only us who designed it will ever know – or come close to the real truth of the stories. Welcome to Elk might look like a “fun” game but it’s about telling stories – some are filled with humour others are dark, but they go hand in hand.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Danish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean']",[],"“Welcome to Elk is funny, sweet, surprising and devastating” Eurogamer “‘Welcome To Elk’ Balances Real World Trauma, Comedy For Its Story” Forbes “The stories are based on real-life events, some of which are emotionally searing and morally perplexing.” Polygon",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1015940/header.jpg?t=1645410507,https://www.welcometoelk.com/,https://www.welcometoelk.com/,astrid@tripletopping.com,True,True,True,82,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/welcome-to-elk?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,172,5,,25,139,"The game contains scenes including deaths and children experiencing murder.

Pick your battles and plan your evacuations carefully! Lose a commander and they’re gone forever; lose everything, and it’s game over! You command the broad strokes of your defenses and monitor positioning — your soldiers do the rest, navigating and engaging intuitively in response to the situation at hand. Each island is both stylistically charming and unique in its layout. Plan your strategies around every nook and cranny, for you only get one chance to save them from the enemy invasion. A stronger, smarter defense leads to greater rewards. Use these to develop your subjects from a ragtag militia into seasoned warriors. Your home is under attack. The king is dead at the hands of Viking invaders. Hope is a distant glimmer in the fog, fading fast with every passing moment. As you rise to take your father’s place as ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defenses. But make no mistake – this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival. Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red. It’s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans. Keep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North .","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Korean', 'Turkish']",[],"“Bad North strips away just the right amount of complexity and headache that real-time strategy games tend to have, resulting in a core experience that is challenging, rewarding, and very replayable.” 4/5 – StrategyGamer “Do not be fooled by the cute sound effects or adorable sprites: Bad North is not a lovely new friend.

There lived a swordsman who was given five swords forged by god himself. Using these swords, the swordsman brought peace and order to the world. People called the swordsman, 'Wielder of the Five Swords'... One day, during a fete to praise the gods, the blades of the swordsman turn against the gods for reasons unknown. One of the gods, Ozone, furious with all his powers, sealed the swordsman away at the top of a mountain now known as Swords Peak. This tale begins 5,000 years after the battle between the two, near a the small village of Cardina. -Game Overview- Seamless open-world game mechanics While the game features a rather old school “quarter view” mechanic, the map transitions and event scenes, even the combat is all seamless as can be to enhance the overall gaming experience. Real time strategic action battle system Utilizing 2 primary attack buttons, users can assign different weapons to each button to create a unique combo that fits the users need as they go. Monsters, bosses and stage gimmicks can require a specific type of weapon at times creating opportunities for users to strategize their best route of approach. Customizable Tattoo system Utilizing 'tattoos', users are given specific points upon leveling to get the protagonist inked as a form of powering up so it could be built to one’s own.

PLAY IT YOUR WAY Most games lock you into a linear plot and if you manage to break free and finish the game, you have no choice but to shelve the game and go in search of another to fill the void. In this game you decide how you play, short term, long term or forever. The choice is yours and the variations are endless. With three unique modes of play, you can choose to either wander the universe as a Commander in Earth’s galactic force, Galactic Command, carrying out your duty of maintaining law and order in allied territories or explore the vast reaches of space. You make your own rules but step out of line and face a court-martial or worse, make a bad decision and your crew die. Decide what you want to do, where you want to go and how you’re going to carry out your goals. Do you invade a planet today or join an NPC controlled force as they attack an enemy station deep in hostile territory? Do you mine for valuable Iridium or do you destroy hostile assets for experience points that eventually lead to increase in the ranks? You can also join a campaign in the Advanced Campaign Mode scenario consisting of a series of missions that are directly affected by the ever changing universe. You can either follow the mission path or ignore orders and move on to the next task in the campaign. To get you going and hone your combat skills, enter Xtreme Carnage and take on space and planetary hostiles as you familiarize yourself with the operation of your fighters. The choice is yours, either way, one day, you’re going to die. You may as well die with a medal and for a good cause.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1755420/header.jpg?t=1632255159,http://3000ad.com/games/,http://3000ad.com/support/,suppport@3000ad.com,True,False,False,0,,0,8,1,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,3000AD,3000AD,Single-player,"Action,Indie,Simulation","Simulation,3D,Space

Who shall return to glory, and who shall remain in exile to the end of their days? Key Features: A New World From the Creators of Bastion and Transistor Experience the biggest and most imaginative world yet from Supergiant ! Get to know an ensemble cast of characters struggling to earn back their freedom as you make your way across the forsaken land called the Downside. Action-Packed Three-on-Three Battle System Battle against a colorful cast of adversaries in pitched, high-stakes confrontations where each victory (or defeat!) brings your exiles closer to enlightenment. Choose three from your party for each Rite, and outfit them with mystic Talismans and powerful Masteries. A Branching Story with No Game-Over In Pyre , you will never be forced to lose progress. Whether you prevail or you fail, your journey continues. The interactive narrative is expressed through a story that no two players will experience in quite the same way. Challenge a Friend in Versus Mode On top of the single-player campaign, Pyre features a local two-player Versus Mode, where you can play against a friend (or CPU opponent) in one of the game's fast-paced ritual showdowns. Form your triumvirate from more than 20 unique characters. Rich, Atmospheric Presentation Pyre once again showcases the award-winning talents of the team that created Bastion and Transistor . From the vibrant hand-painted artwork to the evocative musical score, every aspect of Pyre 's presentation draws you into its fantasy world. Accessible, Customizable Controls and 4K Ultra HD Graphics! Play with gamepad or mouse-and-keyboard using fully customizable controls custom-tailored to PC. The game offers a highly scalable challenge both in the campaign and Versus Mode. Experience it all in stunning 4K resolution (compatible display required)! Unlock 'True Nightwing' Campaign Mode After Finishing the Story Complete the Campaign, then go at it once more, 'ironman'-style, with a unique set of rules, higher stakes, and greater challenge! Explore Pyre 's wide breadth of narrative outcomes as you re-play the story. A Message to Fans of Bastion &amp; Transistor Pyre is our third game as a small independent studio, and was made possible by the success of our first two games, thanks to players like you right here on Steam. This time around, we were excited to make something different from Bastion or Transistor , with a focus on a story-rich presentation, multi-character battles, and many possible narrative outcomes. We hope you'll be surprised and delighted by the result, and that the many characters you’ll meet and stories you experience during your journey stay with you for a long time to come.

758250,Taste of Power,"Oct 10, 2019",0 - 20000,0,0,14.99,0,"Taste of Power is a real-time strategy game set in alternate medieval times, where you fight for one of 3 factions – Europe, China, or the Middle East. In our version of history, nations clash for global dominance. The continent is an epic battlefield, so you’ll have to build cities, recruit troops, study new technologies and wipe out your opponents. Your nation needs a proper commander! New Medieval warfare Tactics are essential in Taste of Power. The numbers of your enemies' troops don't mean much if you meet them with a proper artillery battery. Engineering power has no limits here, as you can build mobile defenses to protect strategic positions. Build underground tunnels to move your forces across the battle lines faster and surprise your opponent! Each nation has a unique set of units. Taste of Power offers a drastically different style of play for each faction. European troops European knights can form different defensive formations, like Phalanx or spear walls. Having troubles in battle? Summon the Crusaders and crush your enemies! Having issues with your army's discipline and morale? Command your monks to encourage your army with the Word of God. You can also use gunpowder and make a difference that way. It's up to you what call to make! Middle Eastern warriors Great warriors, Timurids, can use elephants to help their cause. Command one to crash those around, or get help from chariots with incendiary oils to burn your enemies down. Their engineers are masters of the earth digging techniques – a stealth attack through an underground tunnel will surely be lethal. Yet again, shot-calling is essential and key in the game. Chinese heroes Unlike the Europeans and Timurids, the Chinese have other ways of using gunpowder. Use smokescreens to protect your army from arrows, throw poison grenades and burst low-tech missiles – make the battlefield a living hell for your enemies! After that, you can call for your cavalrymen to end their suffering. You can also set traps for the enemy and medical tents for yourself. The economy of the game is similar to strategy masterpieces. You use workers to collect resources and create different goods. The building phase is simplified, so you could focus on the grand strategy. Learning technologies is important – don’t forget to keep track of your infrastructure! Furthermore, you may be trading with incoming caravans, or simply loot them for goods. The decision is up to you! Taste of Power is a game that challenges your strategy skills. Will you be able to make the right decisions in a limited time-frame? Prove yourself by defeating the brutal AI and feel the Taste of Power!","['English', 'Russian']","['English', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/header.jpg?t=1594017223,http://www.topunivers.com/,,oneoceanua@gmail.com,True,True,True,0,,0,44,21,,24,0,,45,0,45,0,OneOcean LLC,OneOcean LLC,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements",Strategy,"Strategy,RTS,Base-Building,Medieval,Early Access,Alternate History,Historical","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/ss_e51f4a481624cf7d9d45b4a9b90807d90566fccb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1594017223,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/ss_0b497b233e05972720401f1c2846a65cbb4408b0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1594017223,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/ss_f9104056cb03d28df6b822a25a3d22dd342a6565.1920x1080.jpg?t=1594017223,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/ss_13ca31ad46a843a0a6b090024f41965e2903ab69.1920x1080.jpg?t=1594017223,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/ss_a3e7127f290ecdeca9a1cec7d06d47e5962404f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1594017223,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/ss_9fc9f3b5be34c0c9ce761cecb2bce0dc3509a445.1920x1080.jpg?t=1594017223,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/ss_595f23f11db4634c0108cc0fff01dac9fa0a93e5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1594017223,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/ss_02beacb0c2c1c85f68852573a5e6c330e0c0d7e4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1594017223,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/ss_a4f4637bdef8bcae838f844e9f0d4ad31ddfe682.1920x1080.jpg?t=1594017223,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/ss_5ab90930bac0da1cfe22ce04cac582fb66686b87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1594017223,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/758250/ss_aa50f8f50d7ef608a25a577d6126ac4ad45021fe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1594017223",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256763926/movie_max.mp4?t=1570437064

1028520,Brave Battle Saga - The Legend of The Magic Warrior,"Mar 18, 2019",0 - 20000,0,0,9.99,0,"This world was once a civilization brought together by magic and technology. As civilization advanced, those who possessed the power of technology and magic segregated due to their differences in ideas and formed two separate societies of humans and demons. The human race continued to develop their civilization with technology, while the demons started to construct their own society with magic. This balance did not hold for very long, however, and technology was gradually replacing magic. Soon afterwards, an ultimate weapon from the technological civilization appeared, and in an ironic twist of fate, lost control and destroyed the whole world, along with all civilization therein. Nearly a thousand years have gone by without incident, until one day the ancient technology lying deep within the Earth was excavated. Mankind was once again on its way to committing the same mistakes of the past… Since long ago, the world has stood by four mysterious temples controlling the forces of nature, each protecting a kingdom. The Cruz Kingdom governs the water with the Moon Temple. It paints a beautiful picture of a land covered in water. The bold Galien Kingdom emerges as a tropical desert climate near the Sun Temple. It is a unified, intrepid kingdom. In the polar regions is the Zak Empire. Its technical research has flourished with the power of the Star Temple. The Lear Kingdom lies among a picturesque scenery protected by the Wind Temple. It is a matriarchal society. The world was at peace, when suddenly demons from legend appeared throughout the land. Humanity panicked and was at a loss. What have the demons come for? What secrets do the temples hold? Just who is behind all of this? Who will see through this shrouded mystery? Battle Saga - The Legend of the Magic Warrior is a Sega Genesis game that came out only in Taiwanese markets. It has been fully translated to English.

Do Note: Shattered Lights requires a play area of at least 2m x 2m (6 feet and 7 inches). There’s an option to play within a smaller space of 1.5m x 1.5m, but this is not recommended as it makes for a less stable experience, which some may experience as unpleasant.

Do them in your own order. Get bonuses for completing regions and contracts. Some cargoes are easy to get. Others you have to create in industries. Use existing industries and build your own. The further you get from the start the more strategies you have to use. Pimp up your trucks with bonuses. Last truck delivering gets the bonus. The towns and map are to scale. Current or historical industry placement. You could even say that playing is educational. There is plenty more to keep you on your toes. Towns consume the cargoes you are trying to get to completion. Big trucks are great for moving lots of stuff, but can't travel everywhere. There are lots of broken roads that need deliveries. Upgrade the industries for better exponential throughput. Cargo stores can sure come in handy. What! I can't take my big trucks across the water on a ferry. ... and what is with those quarantine checkpoints?

Along the way you will find treasures hidden, or in plain sight, in hard to reach locations or even surrounded by enemies wielding weapons. Weapons You will find your own set of weapons the more you explore. Expect to find a mix of firearms, swords, hammers and more in various locations. The entire world is physics based, so enjoy decimating a variety of enemies in any number of ways. Co-Op Multiplayer Of course you shouldn't do this alone. Big Booty Adventures is best played as a co-op adventure. Have a friend join your game and set out making your own quest in this nonlinear world. Take on enemies, thieve a ship and race each other in various obstacle courses. There is no friendly fire in this realm so feel free to send each other to oblivion as often as you’d like. Expanding World So long as our player base is growing, so too will the world in Big Booty Adventures. Check back in every once in a while for new content as we continue to build new areas.

Pickups enhance the ship and its capabilities Enemies ships evolve and become more difficult Additional obstacles will be added as the game progresses Levels will also add new and exciting events and game mechanics The currently available game mode is called Survival. you get one life and your goal is to survive the round and score the most points possible. Can you set the high score? The current build is Windows only. There will be builds for Mac and Linux in the future. The development will be done on Windows and the alternate packages will come later. Future updates will include new game modes including Arcade and Campaign modes. In arcade mode you will play stage after stage, each getting tougher than the previous. How far you can make it depends on your skill and luck. Your ship upgrades stay with you into the next round and you only reset when you die. You will have a limited number of lives with the ability to earn more through in game pickups and score bonuses. When your last ship is destroyed your game is over. Campaign mode offers you the ability to save your progress. You will be able to acquire, sell, and buy ship upgrades. Before each round you can equip your ship with the upgrades you have available to you in your inventory. You will unlock the ability to purchase an upgrade in the ship store when you collect that upgrade in a game round/level. If you die you lose the equipped upgrades so be careful not to risk too much. In this mode you will be able to retry each level until you complete it and there will be boss fights.

Turtle acrobatics have never been so easy; a single tap on your keyboard, mouse, touch screen, or control pad makes Snappy swim, and whenever there's an obstacle or meanie you can't avoid, execute your indestructible spin move. Those still green around the gills can play in the two casual environments. With their less hectec pace and with Snappy's ability to spin for an unlimited amount of time, even turtle-like reflexes can get Snappy to the goal. Once you've honed your turteling skills you're ready to take on the two Marathon environments, and to replay the casual environments more agressively... risking your shell for higher scores and to unlock all the achievements Snappy Turtle Ultimate challenges you with. The faster Snappy eats consecutive snacks, the higher the score multiplier becomes.

You must then avoid enemy blasters long enough to pass the ball to your team mates, or shoot it into the opposing goal. When your ship is hit by blaster fire it doesn't explode, but you'll drop the ball, and you sure will spin a lot. You'll need to correct your ship's orientation in order to get back into the action! Everyone in the game is flying around freely in the huge, open space arena so be sure to use that freedom to pull off some awesome maneuvers, and epic plays!

Your team is making the final preparations. The band is setting up to perform. And your ship ”The Blue Flamingo” is ready in the hangar. Before we delve further into The Blue Flamingo , we hope you don't mind us taking this opportunity to tell you about our latest game, the Tiny Multiplayer Online RPG Book of Travels! / About The Blue Flamingo : The Blue Flamingo is a straight forward, bite size, Shoot 'em up game created entirely using handmade models. A 32 feet long handcrafted model was built specially for the game, along with countless props and assets that were filmed and photographed. All the effects, rocket flares and explosions were created using firecrackers and other pyrotechnics. Like every other Shmup, this is a game that challenges you to reach the highest possible score. This is made interesting by an economical system that allows you to invest your score in upgrades, which makes earning more score points easier. On the other end, you are rewarded with interest on what is left of your score when you progress to the next level. You have to make a choice - to upgrade and try to regain the score, or rely on your skills to beat the increasingly difficult levels.

In development, I have reduced the consumption of animation and rendering as much as possible to increase the number of units, This turns【MiniMap Kingdom】into a minimalist image game, For players who like gorgeous graphics and shocking content, The game may lack a little charm, But if you like sandbox observation, base construction, city defense games, Find a quiet night and buy it for easy play, I believe you can still find some fun in it. (っ´ω`c) Simple kingdom simulation game The world of MiniMap Kingdom is a simple infinite sandbox, You can freely change the terrain and build your own villages and towns on it, Different villagers will be responsible for producing resources and defending cities, The enemies will also build their own villages on the map, Over time, the map will gradually expand and grow with the development of players and enemies, The player can also be an observer watching the villagers live in the kingdom you build, Hope you can enjoy this game.

You will take command of a newly formed clan of Cro Magnon, in the final days of the Neanderthals. Your goal is survival and dominance. Initially, you will have to command your people to scavenge or hunt for food, while slowly gaining knowledge about plants and animals up to the point where you can start planting crops and herding animals. The world is a dangerous place and you have to ensure the survival of your clan by any means possible. This may mean removing other clans, competing for limited resources in the area. It's a matter of survival, for you and for your clan. Mercy is for the rich and prosperous, for a Cro Magnon clan struggling to survive it will more often than not be counterproductive. Starting out with a small clan, you will have to struggle to find enough food to survive, while protecting your people growing to a number sufficient to defend against - and ultimately destroy - any competition in the area, likewise struggling to survive. Your clan warriors are the key to defending against wild animals and other Cro Magnon clans, but also against aggressive Neanderthals, who are fighting a losing battle for survival of their species.

979260,Gizmo,"Dec 5, 2018",50000 - 100000,0,0,0.0,0,"Earth is being reconstructed and that's bad! Gizmo is a Saturday-morning 3D platformer inspired by 90s classics of the genre. All humans have been put to sleep except for the ingenious Doctor Bolt who is reconstructing the planet into a fully mechanised one! The only problem is that this has taken a long time and he ought to be stopped. Earth is now one huge construction site built by Dr Bolt's population of robots! Collapse into canister form and roll around Arctic Base 4, bouncing off robot heads and slamming into droids at high velocity. Find the transmission beacons among the pipes and platforms, listen to Dr Bolt's broadcasts and discover what's behind that giant locked door. Features One level and a TON of stuff to do in it! You can either take your time and finish the level normally or you can collect all the hidden beacons, kill all the enemies and smash all the barrels. We love high skill ceilings and Gizmo is no exception. For skilled players there is a secret door that will start to close after 60 seconds, leading to a bonus area! And of course, you're timed throughout the whole thing. Gizmo has a surprisingly high level of finesse when speed running and there is a ton of moves and surprising ways of navigating the world that can shed off those valuable seconds! Fully customizable controls so you can play how best suits you. 3 Achievements! -------------------- There is so much we wanted to do with Gizmo. We love the old platformers from the 90s and felt there weren't many new ones that captured the same feeling. We didn't want an open world, we wanted designed, structured levels with clear progression. It turns out it's too much work for us to do on our own, but rather than wasting the project away we decided to clean up what he had and put it on Steam! We believe this is only a slice of a larger game. We want a full platforming game! 25+ levels, different themes set all around the world exploring Dr Bolt's bizarre version of Earth. When developing this concept level, we dreamt up the larger picture first to give the game more depth and direction. This example level stands alone, but presents a lot of the ideas about the characters and setting that belong in a larger game.

In those so called Tafl games two differently sized armies fight each other. The invading black army tries to capture the white king, while the defending white army tries to protect their king and help him escape. Often also called the Game of the Vikings Hnefatafl tells many stories, like the Moskowites' invasion of Sweden or the Viking hordes pillaging Britain. But no matter what the story is, one thing always stays the same: The hunt for the king . Even though the rules aren't complicated the game offers fascinating strategies and rewards tactical play. Try to surround the enemy pieces, plan ahead, lay traps and force your opponent into surrender. Will you capture the king for gold and glory? Can the loyal guards hold back the invading forces and secure the flight of their king? You can even create your own custom variants -- with over 200,000 different variants possible -- for online or offline play! Add jumping pieces, shieldwalls, undying guards, various setps and much more.

We wanted the game to have an immersive story and the first half of it to be a circle-tower-defense-game, meaning that the monsters will not vanish in a portal of some sort, but stay on the screen until you have destroyed them, or there are 100 of them on the screen (in which case you have lost). But other than that, no bells and whistles, just basic action, but neatly balanced, good controls and not too easy. The games controls are RTS-like (that means, that you control a hero, who will do most of the work in-game) and the second half of the levels will change the gameplay to a standard tower-defense game.

563170,Graveball,"Jul 31, 2018",0 - 20000,0,0,4.99,0,"At a local cemetery, sporting goblins have constructed a spooky “Graveball” court that hosts a madcap meld of football and basketball. On this playing field, depraved shovel-wielding creatures compete to maintain possession of the “skullball” and run it into the opposing end zone to score. Of course, there are other ways to get points in this bizarre blood sport, like shooting the skull into a hoop that appears every 30 seconds – or just killing the other team in quick succession. Graveball is a multiplayer combat sports game where teams of 3 goblins compete in a graveyard. Points are awarded by keeping the skull in your opponent's goal for two seconds or by simultaneously eliminating all the members of the opposing team. Death is not the end in Graveball. When your goblin is killed, you respawn as a ghost that moves swiftly around the arena until you are ready to summon a new goblin from the earth. Graveball combines hilarious ragdoll physics, tight controls, and unique gameplay mechanics to create fast-paced, fun-filled matches. Features include: 75% sports game / 25% arena brawler Skill based mechanics (no auto-aim) Online competitive multiplayer with dedicated servers and local co-op play Stat tracking and leaderboards Unlock and equip a variety of masks, weapons, hairstyles and taunts for your goblin",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/563170/header.jpg?t=1533052027,http://www.3drealms.com,http://www.3drealms.com,riley@goinyumbo.com,True,False,False,0,,0,11,2,,20,0,,0,0,0,0,Goin' Yumbo Games,3D Realms,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Stats,Remote Play Together","Action,Indie,Sports","Sports,Action,Indie,Multiplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/563170/ss_93314b769b1d94faf570660eb6368e78b2ddc2d9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533052027,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/563170/ss_37d068661879aa0e2f6fd3c8417c3878316b2a46.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533052027,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/563170/ss_49ffe0ac8e3b99eb4fcb56576bc8a7a5ca53796c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533052027,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/563170/ss_4b0ad17f9262824282fab025e491a31bf8c044e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533052027,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/563170/ss_8ee3ef5ec06596ccb8222a977d7c055aa4ce3a8a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533052027,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/563170/ss_625aff5ec59015b79b80c6771c75d6a4ddec6296.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533052027,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/563170/ss_883ac6d67288fd3f06e2c0eb6d85e1e8bab63073.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533052027,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/563170/ss_24326d3a18800e7cba6b5001cbd11123b7925ad5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533052027",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256717456/movie_max.mp4?t=1533052024

1351070,Pest Control,"Jul 15, 2021",0 - 20000,0,0,3.99,0,"Pest Control is a combination of a simulator and a turn-based strategy, where the main task of the player is to get rid of pests .. Every assignment is a war - small, hairy, full of fangs and legs. Pests have no mercy. When Lenny finds himself alone with them, they only want one thing: to tear him apart! Yes... the job of an exterminator is a challenge! Remember, they are closer than you think! Key features: An extensive system for creating machines, traps, sprays and weapons (Collect parts, modify and improve, you have a whole arsenal at your disposal, from a hammer to a remote-controlled robot) A total of 87 missions (side, story, adventure) (Various types of tasks: neutralize, capture, chase, get rid of any way you want, clean traces) 39 different locations (Villas, ruined apartments, camping sites, warehouses and others) 24 pests (From a rat to a shape-shifting raccoon) Base together with day and night system (Grow your company's headquarters by improving rooms, but remember - time is money!) Unique ways to fight each pest (Set traps, use a swatter or a vacuum cleaner, it’s up to you to choose a method) A wide range of sprays (To get rid of impurities or weaken the opponent, use one of the six substances available in the game) Skill tree (Grow your character as a scientist and engineer, and improve his passive skills) Additional game modes (In addition to story missions and regular tasks, you have special modes, such as: adventure, terror and tower defense) Build traps In the heart of your office you will find a laboratory and a workshop where you can design and modify the most sophisticated traps. The materials that will be used for this can be found in the store as well as during missions. Those can be later used to upgrade traps and weapons. Discover the city You start your work in one of the Cherryhood districts, but as you progress and your reputation grows, you will gain access to new parts of the city. There, of course, the orders will be paid better and the items found will be more and more interesting. The battlefront of your fight with pests runs through home rooms, hotels, factories, laboratories, warehouses and many other unique locations. Upgrade your headquarters Everyone needs a place to return to after work, so you have your own base that you can upgrade. Each of the rooms (gym, laboratory, scrapper) can be expanded, which will bring you new bonuses! Catch pests The tasks are different: sometimes it’s a simple neutralization, sometimes you have to catch a living animal, but each pest requires a different approach. Many of them also have their version on steroids, much stronger and more dangerous than a standard representative. Also, remember to clean up after work: get rid of excrement, lairs, nests, corpses... Nobody likes it when you have to clean up after professionals. PS. During the game creation no animals were harmed.","['English', 'Polish']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/header.jpg?t=1631260867,https://pestcontrolgame.com/,https://pestcontrolgame.com/#contact,office@eon46.com,True,True,False,0,,0,14,5,,10,0,,0,0,0,0,EON46,Ritual Interactive,"Single-player,Steam Achievements","Casual,Indie,Simulation,Strategy","Turn-Based Tactics,Exploration,Tactical RPG,Time Management,Immersive Sim,Hidden Object,PvE,Tutorial,Tower Defense,Strategy RPG,Turn-Based Strategy,Character Customization,Base-Building,Strategy,3D,Economy,Management,Trading,Artificial Intelligence,Crafting","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_305f4cd113d4a5a0c0eebf84eca46ee5f69ea59d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_1d5d6b9e46f767a6520e7ed2b33351bbab0a67db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_60ef254023c518ddd2d85c12f737e394281cebf4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_d69ffe020884c271882491db1003250be2e857f4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_6eccc55bb36494ae58ae6fcdab9567f7a4a8481b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_5b10697fc6438ea4ace6b3e9b01c3164bfb95ce2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_d69ffe020884c271882491db1003250be2e857f4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_5f7de66592c8f7f1b85a02906ff3b50a7587728d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_cd7430f1416fac1c41b10f231b3a5df02fc9396a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_0aae53c3f8f84e329819f947e40f1933b1b5ddfd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_07000b4df817deb5040e92dd5f6c2c8435cfc880.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_8d23908c18774edbf3e048d787f44b79c7c4ec79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_5dc62321afd6f041acc5a65db0ac7a83fb664ef1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_bb1944287ce4e44c4897ad4337254491014b7c40.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_df34bebb5225a4121d1280f404023de55814a0ab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_47e208d41c0312449bb83deb98016c4f3b782d9b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_34a982d51f36e94b8f7436c71e495d2a2ddb3da0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_26e94090e681a31b1900d5947535424590097d26.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_75829cad1fbec5298cadfb7411d4182192dad7d6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351070/ss_d6675b3693a5c118cc3a36df186fe6cad5a6d3fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631260867",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256838238/movie_max.mp4?t=1623328036

DRIVE 'A party of adventurers set to explore the dungeon'. Sounds familiar? The Underground King is a classic RPG adventure disguised as a racing game. Driver Types : Based on classic RPG archtypes, we reflavored their background and personality to belong in our world. Hobo (Fighter), Urchins (Rogue), Biker (Paladin), etc. Each driver comes with a unique name, backstory, body type, stats, and a random skill. Driver Skills : Each driver comes with their own activatable ability. These are physic-based actions that will help you surpass obstacles, damage enemies, navigate the track, etc. Vehicle Types : Vehicles have from 1 up to 4 seats for drivers and proportional bonuses depending on the seat count. Like the drivers, each car comes with a unique identity, random paint job, and random stats. Team Management : You are able to assemble multiple teams composed of one vehicle and at least one driver. You can match and sort different combinations to surpass specific challenges (such as building a team to survive a meteor shower ). DEFEAT Race Tracks : Procedurally generated terrain designed to challenge you in unique ways.

They might drop unique Boss Set items, which when completed, will grant you special effects and high stats. Obstacles &amp; Weather : Obstacles are designed to hinder you but you can also use them to damage / slow your enemies. The weather influences your speed and acceleration and some spawn dangers (such as lightning bolts , meteor showers , etc.). Team vehicles are physical objects that move throughout the level. They can collide with each other, activate traps, break obstacles into pieces, etc. Domino effects can occur, adding to the chaotic fun that is physics-based gameplay! That goes double for EXPLOSIONS ! LOOT Text Adventures (Happenings) : Adventures scattered throughout the island for your drivers to explore. Rewards await for those who seek them! Shop Opportunities : Wandering merchants will offer to buy or sell things from you. Some will ask for specific item types while others for are only interested in quality .

These either add bonus stats or simple percent-based effects (such as '5% chance for double-damage). We have added a few already and aim to add a whole lot more during Early Access . REPEAT World Laws: 30+ unique effects that change the game mechanics in a fun &amp; rewarding way. New Week : Each week, the island changes, with different Weather , Happenings , Shops , and Racing Tracks . A new World Law will take effect and influence your experience. This stacks with any permanent laws you accumulated from previous sessions (if any). Win a game : Survive for 30 in-game days. For each playthrough survived, you unlock a permanent World Law that will influence your next plays. World Laws are stackable, so you can have multiple at once (if you can keep up a winning streak that is).

312560,Xanadu Next,"Nov 3, 2016",20000 - 50000,1,0,14.99,0,"Whenever mist hangs over the waters of Lake Orwell on Harlech Island, sailors catch sight of a phantom castle just out of reach. As they draw near, it fades into the fog like a mirage, leaving only questions for all who have borne witness to this “Castle Strangerock.” An up-and-coming scholar named Charlotte L. Wells has had her interest piqued by this local legend and desperately wishes to study it in person—but of course, Harlech Island is no place for an unescorted young lady. To aid her in her investigation, therefore, she enlists the help of an old childhood friend and fallen knight who agrees to accompany her on this adventure. Arriving in Harlech and catching sight of Castle Strangerock almost immediately, Char dives into researching the mystery head-on, leaving her companion to explore the surrounding environs on his own in search of any artifacts that might help trace the origins of this ephemeral stronghold. Sadly, this almost immediately leads to his death at the hands of a mysterious swordsman seemingly displaced in time...but death is to be only the beginning of his adventure. Xanadu Next is an exploration-centric action RPG from Nihon Falcom, the acclaimed creators of the Ys and The Legend of Heroes RPG franchises. A late entry in their immensely popular Dragon Slayer series and a spiritual follow-up to the late ‘80s cult classic Faxanadu , Xanadu Next puts players in the shoes of a gravely injured knight given a new lease on life through ancient magic who must now seek a legendary sword called “Dragon Slayer” to ensure his survival. Players will fight hordes of monsters in real time while exploring the lush, mysterious and perilous environments of Harlech Island, along with the ruins of an ancient paradise known as Xanadu that was partially inspired by tales of the Mongolian emperor Kublai Khan. Along the way, players will uncover bits and pieces of Xanadu’s past in the form of ancient stone tablets and memorandums, piecing together a complex tale of magic, war, an ancient dragon, and a mysterious figure known only as the “Black Bride.” Features An Interconnected World Full of Secrets Icy peaks connect with fiery caverns, old waterways, mystical forests and magical ruins, creating one single giant map to explore with countless secret passageways, alternate routes, shortcuts, hidden items, deadly bosses and new techniques to uncover. Real-Time Combat with Dozens of Unique Abilities Fight ruthless enemies in real time, using a wide variety of skills to aid you. As in Ys SEVEN , skills are attached to weapons and can be learned through repeated use of those weapons, adding an element of excitement and promise to every new armament found. Exploration Rewarded with Rich Backstory Stone tablets and old letters are scattered throughout the ruins on Harlech Island, each written in an ancient tongue. Fortunately, your companion is an accomplished scholar who can translate them for you in real time, providing valuable insight into important events and mythologies from the age of Xanadu. Unique Gameplay Systems that Keep the Experience Fresh Players can choose to level-down in order to tweak their stats, fuse themselves with “Guardians” to gain new passive abilities, learn spells, and even carve keys from monster bones to lessen demand for pre-made keys and keep their prices low. Atmospheric Visuals and Music in Classic Falcom Tradition Inspired by hardcore dungeon RPGs of the '80s and created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Xanadu , one of Japan's action RPG forefathers, Xanadu Next mimics the gritty, medieval look of its ancestor, but in full 3D and with ample amounts of subtle detailing, as well as a foreboding and wholly unique soundtrack composed by Falcom's venerable Sound Team jdk.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/header.jpg?t=1624575934,http://www.xanadunext.com,www.xseedgames.com,support@xseedgames.com,True,False,False,78,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/xanadu-next?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,386,31,,15,379,,42,0,42,0,Nihon Falcom,"XSEED Games,Marvelous USA, Inc.","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Action,RPG","RPG,Action,Action RPG,Great Soundtrack,JRPG,Dungeon Crawler,Singleplayer,Anime,Isometric,Atmospheric","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/ss_e4c1aca8e8d029f1c1ab1694c0e1fae435fb7c55.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575934,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/ss_91f6f84a3740b89753cd57f05d1a366fe90d517f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575934,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/ss_f02b02ce142132e0cef4bad64c0426ca97c343cb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575934,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/ss_85c957a855e4e1658fcbb6f525dc86aaaebf3de9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575934,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/ss_7acad5fdd7679bc51b55a6ce9e6e557a4cdf6fbd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575934,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/ss_c811368864819c37f1961795781904ffcf167fd3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575934,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/ss_580dd800ca7bccc3bd27dc9a9c9c2ae09bac3a64.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575934,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/ss_09253d727bc0b1d04157d3786f75e517c3fe9c99.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575934,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/ss_3719bd062eb86888d7e31c4dc7074e054dc0e38e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575934,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/ss_1a8cfeddee7729c04874909809f2456793351d7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575934,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312560/ss_26376bec8691055031d7cc093746652ed7771be4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575934",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256672942/movie_max.mp4?t=1477096213

To allow more players interact with the world and go on adventure together. - More minigames covering different sports/activities - Other competitive modes (race, capture-the-egg, destroy enemies egg etc) - Seasonal/Themed levels and planets to explore - i.e. Halloween planet, Toys planet, Christmas planet etc. - Chest to store items near the farm - Farming elements","['English', 'Polish']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/header.jpg?t=1655634234,https://www.amazingchickenadventures.com/,https://www.amazingchickenadventures.com/,,True,False,False,0,,0,2,1,,10,0,,0,0,0,0,Piotr Rochala,Piotr Rochala,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Stats,Remote Play Together","Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie,Early Access","Early Access,3D Platformer,Platformer,Exploration,Precision Platformer,Co-op,Local Co-Op,3D,Split Screen,Puzzle-Platformer,Puzzle,Sandbox,Indie,Action-Adventure,Action,Cute,Funny,Physics,Relaxing,Casual","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_2521e144ee22d2c024bf2eaa8cf28829a51c6486.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_1580b77acf9e54a1e232b10a50d38bcd1e334618.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_2338197dccd69a51d8559ac0bb29396161a04ba4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_fff11e7327ed3b59a76b4ed0d2e397e676ab2686.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_e601d01561a2d014993bfd505a5b6d17221f295e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_41be2dcf3bd4e56a29ab15be0a2a8b8f7cbbbf2d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_1d73689430565b6d541a2fbe87fe7693e7b53da7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_5718b87dcf89c5902286c9eb4aa38053b68ecc30.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_205d7c02518b7bc145fd2a767934870376de3679.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_3cb75e757bc6be458c10cd3f74347f95071ddb6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_158a70a8a7ab04df948bfe981f8cb57dc89a81e5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_dec6c76aae860f7cf212f787c65c14e7b50127d7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_8e806361da0d4d1fee8338cb4c2acb803cb19585.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1525370/ss_6b4d1dc1cec51fc5ab11e798528114624486d3ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655634234","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256830054/movie_max.mp4?t=1627306068,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256850214/movie_max.mp4?t=1630728784,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256850216/movie_max.mp4?t=1630730111,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256850217/movie_max.mp4?t=1630730119"

17470,Dead Space,"Jan 9, 2009",1000000 - 2000000,170,0,19.99,0,"Only the Dead Survive. A massive deep-space mining ship goes dark after unearthing a strange artifact on a distant planet. Engineer Isaac Clarke embarks on the repair mission, only to uncover a nightmarish blood bath  the ship's crew horribly slaughtered and infected by alien scourge. Now Isaac is cut off, trapped, and engaged in a desperate fight for survival. Strategically dismember the Necromorph enemies limb by bloody limb. Zero gravity combat means terror can strike from anywhere. Uncover the horrific truth of this shocking thriller. Game Features: Messy monster slaying The Necromorphs are unlike any enemies you've seen before. Headshots do about as much damage to them as flicking rubber bands. To survive, you'll need to dismember their insect-like limbs, one at a time. Improvised weapons There aren't many traditional firearms aboard the Ishimura, but there's plenty of stopping power in Isaac's toolkit. Send horizontal or vertical blasts of energy at enemies with the Plasma Cutter, remotely control a high-speed sawblade with the Disc Ripper, and fill hallways with wide swaths of destruction with the Line Gun. Switch things up with alternate fire modes, and purchase upgrades to increase ammo, power, and reload speed. Real-time attacks. Whatever you do, don’t drop your guard. Everything takes place in real-time. That means any action you take, whether it be reloading or digging through your inventory, gives the Necromorphs a perfect opportunity to attack. This nightmare has just begun and it’s up to get to the bottom of what happened here.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/header.jpg?t=1627659306,http://deadspace.ea.com/agegate.aspx?returnURL=/Default.aspx,https://help.ea.com/,,True,False,False,86,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dead-space?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,20216,1946,,0,16949,,601,398,136,398,EA Redwood Shores,Electronic Arts,"Single-player,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV","Action,Adventure","Horror,Sci-fi,Action,Space,Third Person,Survival Horror,Atmospheric,Singleplayer,Third-Person Shooter,Gore,Shooter,Aliens,Dark,Futuristic,Story Rich,Silent Protagonist,Adventure,Survival,Zombies,Immersive","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006481.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006482.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006483.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006484.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006485.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006486.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006487.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006488.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006489.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006490.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006491.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006492.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006493.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006494.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006495.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006496.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006497.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006498.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006499.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17470/0000006500.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627659306",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5163/movie_max.mp4?t=1585425675

487160,Trials of Azra,"Sep 15, 2016",0 - 20000,0,0,9.99,0,"Play as Sam, a kid that controls the dead! Defeat your enemies with magic and control their bodies to solve challenging puzzles! Sam, a regular kid whose life usually consists of drinking chocolate milk and playing with his dog, finds himself trapped in a dark realm with newly found necromancy abilities, and a strange man who claims to be his guide. Help this young boy find his way through the Trials of Azra for his own survival. Will you be able to set him free and unveil the truth behind the mysterious ordeal forced upon him? 20+ enemies to defeat and control 60+ rooms filled with puzzles Challenging Boss fights Upgrade your basic attack and learn new spells Several areas with diverse environments Local co-op Full compatibility with Xbox Controller The gameplay is mainly about defeating and controlling your enemies, then using them to solve increasingly difficult puzzles. Once you control an enemy, you can switch back and forth between it and Sam. This ends either when the controlled enemy dies, or you start controlling another enemy (you can control just one at a time). The game features local co-op, which will probably (if you and your buddy get along) make things a little faster and more fun. Careful though, now there are 2 players who can mess up a puzzle or get killed by a deadly trap! The main way to deal with Sam's foes is by using magic. Aside from the basic projectile, there is a number of spells to learn. Spells consume mana, so you should keep an eye on that blue bar.

Using real audio gathered at protests, scripted scenes, and documentary footage, the film is a powerful hybrid documentary-fiction depiction of the gauntlet that many abortion providers, health center staff, and patients must walk on a typical day in America. The experience consists of three scenes. We begin inside the health center, finding ourselves in an exam room with a young woman and a compassionate doctor. The scene fades as we travel back in time to follow the patient and her friend as they drive up to a health center lined with protesters holding graphic signs and shouting.

Through the unique cgNEAT content-generation technology, new weapons are constantly created by the game automatically. Experiment A key objective of this game is to explore the potential for automated content generation technology to intelligently create content for games. In GAR, all player weapons are generated by the cgNEAT algorithm based on weapon usage statistics. However, cgNEAT does not simply respawn weapons that people like. Rather, it creates new weapons that elaborate on those that have been popular in the past. Game Mechanics GAR combines elements of old-school space shooters like Star Control, action-RPGs like Diablo, and open-world space adventure games like Freelancer. The graphics are fully 3D but in top-down or '2.5D' mode. The chase camera and movement interface is similar to many online RPGs such as WoW. Earn ranks and credits by completing missions and destroying enemies. Use the credits earned to upgrade and customize your gun ship. Galaxy The game progresses through different and increasingly challenging solar systems. Throughout the galaxy are various factions, both friendly and hostile. Game Modes GAR game modes include (1) single player campaign mode, (2) instant-action system defense mode, and (3) multiplayer mode for up to 32 players with both coop and PVP. You can run your own Galactic Arms Race galaxy by downloading the standalone server.

Naval units stack in fleets. Stacking is 1 land, 1 air, 1 fleet per hex. Land units have the capacity of having a specialization. This is an attachment of equipment, elite trained units, or gear. With advancements, this allows for 120 different land unit configurations. COUNTRY MANAGEMENT Production takes into account oil, manpower, logistics, strategic resources, trade agreements, convoy zones. The system allows you 17 different advancements and each unit has at minimum 2 advancement choices. You can have 47 different unit configurations. The supply system is based on cities, rail, ports, headquarters, and distance from railways. The supply system more accurately represents the difficulties of supplying troops overseas in the Pacific. The WarPlan engine has a built in diplomatic mechanic available but for the Pacific theatre it is disabled at the scenario level. SCENARIOS Pacific 1941 – This scenario starts on December 7th 1941 with the attack at Pearl Harbor. It allows the players to experience the full war from start to finish. Pacific 1942 – This scenario starts on May 1942 just before the Battle of Coral Sea. This allows players to skip the initial landings and get right into the carrier battle action. China 1937 – Replay the invasion of China until the start of the war in Europe. Excellent introduction scenario for the land war. Okinawa 1945 – A short introduction scenario so players can get a feel for the land and naval systems. Solomons 1942 – Experience one of the most challenging and interesting segments of the Pacific war. Equal sides, different strengths, weaknesses, and goals.

Realistic battle depiction Each turn in the game represents one day with each day broken into phases. In each phase you get to move, support, or attack following a strategy that has to combine enemy lines penetration, HQ communication lines, and overall support for the units that are in heavy contact with the enemy. Units are approximately company-sized. A challenging strategic problem Be warned this is not an easy game to win. You will need to exercise Command and Control over your units by keeping them in range of their HQ to retain their effectiveness in battle. Armor should be used in a supporting role and not in the front lines otherwise the Japanese will eat them for breakfast. Troops need to rest and not be constantly engaged in combat. Numbers are on your side but the enemy has strong defensive positions and amazing fighting ability. Make the most of your resources Use the support points on units that are likely to be fired upon by the Japanese, especially when moving, to reduce your losses. Keep your units fatigue levels low by resting them from combat as they will become less effective as they keep on fighting.",['English'],[],"“Battle for Iwo Jima is an excellent example of the historical depth a simple wargame can have with the right design theory to back it up.

But as a puppet that absorbs all it touches, you can try to rescue as much of Earth's greatness as you can before the end arrives. In the beginning, you roam the Earth, capable of absorbing only the tiniest of objects. A glass marble you collect becomes your head, and a pair of jellybeans becomes your hands. Small creatures overwhelm you, with rats kicking you around and golden retrievers threatening to stomp you to pieces. But with every object you collect, your puppet self grows larger. Eventually, you'll become a towering behemoth with fire engines for arms and the ability to absorb entire buildings. The Wonderful End of the World takes you through 12 unique locations, with over a thousand treasures to gather before the end comes. Steal some sweets from the candy store, where gummi fish swim in a blueberry river; visit a surrealist library to find that the words have literally leapt out of their books; and explore the Megalopolis, where you'll watch a lively end-of-the-world parade and then gobble it up before making your way to grab the tallest skyscraper ever built. 10 achievements for exploring and unlocking secret areas of the game 12 unique locations to explore 3 gameplay modes: Timed, Timeless, and Exploration 16 bouncy music tracks keep the action rocking.

770020,Royal Tumble,"Jan 9, 2018",0 - 20000,0,0,0.99,0,"Meet King Ono, ruler of Square land, beloved by all. That is, apart from his arch enemy Lord Void, who will stop at nothing to dethrone him. The King lacks any meaningful construction skills so he needs you to build his castles for him, using nothing but the latest in cutting edge building materials including.. wood, stone and ... iron. You had better make them strong and sturdy too, because Void's loyal, cannon wielding minions will do all they can to destroy them, and send your King tumbling down to the cold, hard ground. Protect the King's gold coins and gunpowder stashes and he will reward you, but if he suffers because of your inadequate castle building skills he'll wuss out and surrender, or even worse.. die, meaning you'll see none of those glorious shiny things. Oh.. and whatever you do, be sure to keep those gunpowder barrels out of sight from the attackers, or your king will be taking a royal flight. Attack Mode Had enough of the King's high and mighty attitude? Take Lord Voids place and plan the attack on the King's castles yourself, before taking control of his minions and their devastatingly accurate (ish) cannons. Destroy the King's coin chests and you'll steal the contents, provided you make the King surrender or send him to his fate. Level Builder Want to make your own levels? Want to place the king at dizzying heights above a cluster of high explosive gunpowder barrels and create an explosion Michael Bay would be proud of? Use custom level slots to create your very own levels, controlling everything from the type and amount of building materials available, to the amount of cannon ammunition the attackers have.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/header.jpg?t=1515930500,http://4shawgames.com/royal-tumble.html,https://twitter.com/matthew4shaw,shawgames@outlook.com,True,True,False,0,,0,8,4,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,4ShawGames,4ShawGames,Single-player,"Action,Casual,Indie,Simulation,Strategy","Casual,Strategy,Action,Indie,Simulation,Building,Physics","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_6455538abb6beafa2fd2a18fa5ac59bd3011b05e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_f7a9c096b4d5bd7f4ba9bebae6bd23ed13ae1cea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_2f0b79b94f4c812caacae53c1028905eff983602.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_838d2b32556f55f7e6147f4c0c0b0af5eaf7c449.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_ac072e21fe5b450b877b37b4b3c2bcd18cb0a473.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_fcac851f177a87f6f7bb3c16175739db6c61ff8f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_e82fc3cc883dd711bbc0ad8ed43cdf065863bd87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_b024102b85e01825a30b20ccf3ed602e68130962.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_b55af3dee0db314c5881e9319b9ea3bb0bc02283.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_934f3a4424d469c2caa922a50b6abedd7d77ab32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_a5a3e02269b8af05eefeebebf1da495f79a367bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_916b8cad5237db03afb833d7979861c24b54fbed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_e15e4f0381cbec5a31635ee3eacb3aaa20306ce6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_d026267e8544152b33e29e2fc9806ef4d505e9a1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_6f63175edfe71d3597988e027c55d9ef2c3cc213.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_63eec9fba75c10bc64d845bdb3653d8b2f6c72c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_f32430671222c1f04fbbd8d5ef43134f7b80122d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_6775c3d8a5bfaf070c49aa1acb445b5c048864bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_916b8cad5237db03afb833d7979861c24b54fbed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_3b16593a7c50bde5104ea3113f6283bb657839c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770020/ss_ec269443b79bed0d4c0501102dc6f741c203af86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1515930500",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256705027/movie_max.mp4?t=1515012629

705870,Echo Grotto,"Sep 20, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,7.99,0,"Echo Grotto is a virtual reality experience that lets you explore unique and intricate cave systems using a range of caving gear and tools! Traverse underwater tunnels, huge open caverns, crystal caves, massive ravines, sulfur pools, deep pits, glow-worm lit grottos and much more! Echo Grotto uses subtle random generation to make every cave system feel unique, while still delivering amazing locations and deeply interconnected caves since every cavern and passage is handmade and uniquely designed. Each time you embark down into the caves of Echo Grotto you will never know what’s around the corner! Before you descend into a new cave system you can choose what gear you want to take with you. You might choose another locomotion method (like a grappling hook) or maybe an additional light source like a headlamp or lantern. Maybe you would rather take a snorkel with you so that you can reach the underwater portions of the caves? Or maybe a flare gun to easily light up things in the distance. There are many different tools to choose from! You can explore the caves using a unique teleportation system, where you throw a small ‘teleporter lamp’ and you will be teleported to where it lands. This lamp will leave a trail of previous lamps behind you, resulting in a trail of lights that leads you back the way you came! Much like how cavers would leave a string behind them as they go, your teleporters leave a wire and trail of lights for you to retrace your steps. Another locomotion option is a pair of caving hooks, which you can use to freely 'grab and move' yourself around the environment! Choose to play as either an 'experience' or a 'game'. Choosing 'experience' will allow you to pick whatever gear you want from the start and simply explore the caves as you wish, while choosing 'game' will include a progression system, where you start with only basic tools and must search for more within the caves. It also employs a simple currency system, where you can use various gemstones found within the caves to get better tools! You can also play a range of special ‘scenarios’ which alter the gameplay in unique ways. For example, you can explore a flooded cave system, start the game from an alternative entrance or play with nothing but glowsticks! Some scenarios are like special challenges, like starting the game already deep into a cave system with only a candle (which will run out over time!). You will also find a range of cave-dwelling creatures in Echo Grotto. Keep an eye out for snails, eels and wetas! But if you’re not a fan of creepy-crawlies you can always set which animals can be found in the caves (or even none at all). Go and see for yourself what’s deep in the caves of Echo Grotto!",['English'],[],“I carried more memories out of these caves than I have done in most other VR games ...

980440,Knights Rubbish,"Dec 6, 2018",0 - 20000,0,0,3.99,0,"A co-op platformer fighter game made with real photos, featuring our beloved character Keshia Erasia and his friends. They have risen from the rubbish and they seek for adventures. Invite a friend (you can also play alone if you don't have any friends) and play as your favorite rubbish! Exciting, eh? Key Bindings: -rubbish/knights-rubbish-manual.pdf Features 5 hilarious heroes to choose from. Local co-op arcade. Cool combo skills. 5 levels in total. (About 2 hours of gameplay.) Amazing photo realistic graphics. Fun. It only costs you couple dollars and cents. Can't think of any other note-worthy features, sorry. The Knights Keshia Erasia Combos Demo: Keshia Erasia was once the happiest eraser in the world. His owner Bobby had always placed him inside an exquisite aluminum box after using him. Though becoming smaller everyday, Keshia still enjoyed the time with Bobby…until one day, Bobby tripped on a crossbar and dropped his aluminum box on the sidewalk. The pain was enough for Bobby to forget the aluminum box and left. Keshia thus became just another forsaken rubbish on the side walk. Depressed, angered, and ERASAAAIED! Keshia picked up his companion Pencil and founded Knights Rubbish because why not? He planned to recruit other poor rubbish along his adventure. Wendy Floopy Combos Demo: Wendy Floopy was once the 6th installation floppy disk of a famous operating system. However, then came CDs, USB drives, and well, cloud downloads as replacements of floppies, so her owner Bobates the Software Engineer tossed her in the recycling box without another glimpse. Bored, Wendy’s biggest interest became collecting CDs in the recycling box. One day, Keshia Erasia, the founder of Knights Rubbish happened to pass by and fall in love with Wendy, but Wendy refused Keshia because he is ugly. Nonetheless, Wendy and Keshia still remained good friends, and Wendy became a crucial member in Knights Rubbish. Ranawato Plato Combos Demo: Ranawato Plato was once the most beloved plate of a famous philosopher, Bobus. As bad luck would have it, Bobus committed suicide due to the pain of existence. Ranawato then became an unused plate on the shelf (aka. rubbish). Overwhelmed by sad emotions, Ranawato dreamed of her deceased owner every night…until one day, a handsome spoon came and introduced himself. Ranawato thus forgot her past owner and ran away with the spoon. It turned out that the spoon was not only handsome, but magical. Ranawato realized that she could actually communicate with the spoon by telepathy and the spoon could do a lot of magical tricks. Together, they roamed the world, performing magic tricks and impressed some depressed souls. The founder of Knights Rubbish, Keshia Erasia happened to be among the audiences in one of Ranawato and the spoon’s magic show. Extremely spellbound by the show, Keshia recruited Ranawato as a member of Knights Rubbish. The spoon wasn’t recruited because Keshia didn’t like spoons, nonetheless, Keshia agreed that Ranawato carry the spoon anywhere she went. Othox Codox Combos Demo: -tASFdM Othox Codox was once a magic codex written by the famous sorcerer Bobbington. Unfortunately, Bobbington was executed because homosexuality wasn’t legal then. All Bobbington’s precious publications were torn and ripped, some burnt in the merciless flames. Othox, though almost ripped into shreds, called for the Blessings of Rabimouchinus and granted a wheel chair to aid him. He practiced the magic written inside him as he ran away from the murderers and gradually became one of the greatest magic codex in the world. The founder of Knights Rubbish, Keshia Erasia recruited Othox because Knights Rubbish lacked a mage. Sirurueruerue Senyesuensuesue &amp; Sugsesugsem Sosas Combos Demo: Sirurueruerue Senyesuensuesue &amp; Sugsesugsem Sosas were once the best selling mp3 players. However, smart phones became a thing and they were thrown into the recycle bin by their owner Bobs. They joined the local gang inside the bin and became the SS brothers (even though they had no genetic ties). The gang leader Big Brother had good relationship with the founder of Knights Rubbish, Keshia Erasia, so he referred the SS brothers to Keshia. After one technical interview, one behavior interview, and one on-site interview, Sirurueruerue and Sugsesugsem finally became members of Knights Rubbish. They discarded their former title “SS brothers” for transitional justice’s sake.",['English'],[],“Good Job!” 9.99993/10 – My Mom,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/header.jpg?t=1544198943,http://shinerightstudio.com/knights-rubbish/,http://shinerightstudio.com/knights-rubbish/,chaoyu@link.cuhk.edu.hk,True,True,True,0,,0,1,1,,37,0,,0,0,0,0,Yu Chao,Yu Chao,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Stats,Remote Play Together","Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie,RPG,Early Access","Action,Indie,Early Access,Casual,Adventure,RPG,Platformer,Co-op,Local Co-Op,Experimental","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_f4dabc6ead1c54fe5b43984b42362a45e55b6c6c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_4e6f32048d482f89dd41f99ee8e17492f7c7ce58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_b832f3f553915bcc86066ab23c001832b727d266.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_2055ce99c2887e2f5065e8b24d407d799fd68131.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_aeef3a0e0095b7ad0a48e5802e46a6ea3701eb6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_9c2dc8fb323ead9500a1b634256766eb0f3fee35.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_49f1aa52898989ba563aa02e6357439d764e922a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_631de6a09e227dd2e07c2511e9b78b1b5824d4ee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_e397db4c54c4efb366b0e0759e6f2dc7f92e44b9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_0bfcbae6f3c989a06a4fb9a43eae1985cbb80879.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_7f5c3f2b42fc5295cec3852d84dde5d90a164e06.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_7139e2a65a085794d8240a32652c32e4cb5c6ef8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_b04c066cda12c622f2815c8f1e13c0745289bdb1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_ffb527725f6bae4b2d9a5a91b3d04bbfbe229694.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_565ec4894088acd2fcdf9bc4d02df6bf303e0a1d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_1ec4707e02ca446d239f6ff902116a14f303d120.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/980440/ss_78aee2f8253c9e29a883c26bde5fc7eef6ea5764.1920x1080.jpg?t=1544198943",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256736048/movie_max.mp4?t=1542906212

Pick up your weapons, choose your classes (Mage, Archer, Warlock, Priest), team up with other players, and banish evil demons to protect the world! Game Feature • Extensive team cooperation and strategy • Unique and diverse classes and skills • Challenging and intriguing raids • Interaction with global players across different VR platforms • Loot collection and character development • Actual physical body movements in VR Classes and skills Age of Heroes involves multiple classes: mage, warlock, archer, priest, and warrior. The uniqueness of the classes creates opportunities for strategy and teamwork between players. Each class has its own skill set and development. By choosing different skills, you can create your own play style and create a character that best fits your own strategy and personality. At launch, 4 classes will be available: Mages are noble masters of the element power from the Energy Source. Mages can deal powerful Area of Effect (AoE) and slow enemies attacks. Archers are professionally-trained fighters who shoot volleys of arrows upon their foes. The faster the arrows are shot, the more damage they can inflict. Warlocks can summon mighty golems. Warlocks are drawn to the dark side of the Energy Source. They have mastered the way of fighting demons. Priests are the key supporters in a team. Their healing and resurrection skills are crucial in raids. After launch , we will add the warrior class: Warriors are tanks and have massive defensive abilities. Warriors are best suited for near or middle range attacks. Challenging and intriguing raids At launch, there will be 3 different raids: Hall of Death, Freezing Stronghold, and Fort of Horror. Each raid contains battles and bosses that require team cooperation and different raid strategies. Actual body movements In Age of Heroes, you need physical body movements like ducking or quick dodging to avoid darts and boss special abilities. Age of Heroes adapts for different room sizes, you can set different game configurations to complete all tasks with just slight movements for small rooms or change the configuration to use big movements for larger rooms. Physical movements are triggered when you see the alert on the ground or hear the NPC voice alert, then you know it’s time to react. Loot and character development Players have a chance to loot scrolls that permanently enhance the skills of heroes after each battle. With different skill builds and team strategies, every single combat is a new fight. For example, the healing skill scroll will transform priest’s healing skill from individual healing into group healing. This change frees your teammates from frequent hit-and-run so they can focus more on attack. Talk to your teammates to make team combat fun and effective!  Play with heroes worldwide Age of Heroes includes single-player mode and multiplayer mode. In multiplayer mode, you may set up your own game or join an existing game. Each game allows a party of up to 5 players.

Also, you can use build-in audio chatting system to communicate with your teammates if your VR gear supports audio inputs. DLCs in the future New class DLC coming soon: A new class, warrior, will be added soon after launch. Warrior is the symbol of courage, loyalty and justice. They fight enemies in the front of the battle line and protect teammates by shields. With warrior, players can develop more team combat strategies.

Their only weakness, and yours, is sunlight, which means there's only one way to stop them: call them out on the streets, knock their clothes off, and expose their skin before they can do it to you. Arm yourself with a rolled-up poster, a guitar, a laptop, a magical girl wand, or (if you insist) an actual weapon, then hit Akihabara's colorful streets. Browse recreations of real-life shops circa 2011, mingle with Akiba's residents and tourists, and discover the town's many secrets. Will you work with the secret paranormal-hunting agency, give the creatures a fair shake (hey, some of them seem all right), or just look out for your otaku friends? Choose your side, choose your missions, and enjoy a freewheeling adventure with AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound &amp; Debriefed.

Similar to trading card packs, you have a chance of getting what you want when you open one.

413540,Recourse,"Feb 29, 2016",0 - 20000,0,0,19.99,0,"Curiosity is a sign of intelligence. Journey to a scenic arctic planet inhabited by experimental A.I. units and discarded robots. Play as Sleet, a sentient robot confronted with a series of puzzles and has little idea what's going on. Then meet Floe, an older A.I. unit, willing to help you proceed and unravel the mysteries of this beautiful desolate planet. Key Features Puzzle Variety: Recourse offers a content rich puzzle solving experience with more than 100 different elements. Length: It takes about 25-30 hours to finish the core game. Unlocking all possible secrets and achievements will take more depending on how good you'll become in the end. The core game consists of 14 large Puzzle maps in addition to 5 Payload and 5 Wave Rush levels. 3 Game Modes: Puzzle, Payload and Wave Rush (read more below). Character mobility: Dash, jet-boost, grapple, and fly your way around the levels to quickly reach any point. You are never ever limited to the ground. Unlockables: You can upgrade Floe, access new levels and if you manage to collect all golden question marks, you'll be awarded with the advanced modules for 'WINTER' - Floe's favourite weapon on the entire planet. Drop-In/Drop-Out Split-Screen Co-Op: A second player can seamlessly join or leave the game at any time to help you. Enemies: If you're ever bored of solving puzzles, you can dive into more action-packed game modes and battle your way through hordes of Failbots to unlock Floe's upgrades. Deployables : You can deploy eight different tools (Circular Saw, Incinerator, Tesla Coil, Laser, Vortex, Point A, Thumper and Singularity) to interact with the environment or counter enemies (find more information below). Environmental Hazards: It's not perfectly safe to wander around though. There are many hazards on the planet. Some of them can be turned on/off and even converted to your side. Color-coded Objects: Blue glowing objects are on your side. Orange glowing objects are on Failbots' side. Yellow glowing objects hate everyone. Achievements as Challenges: There are 53 achievements and many of them are rewarded upon the completion of a specific challenge. Challenges can be viewed at Floe's terminal. More to come: A free map pack is already in the works. It builds on the core game and introduces new puzzle elements and challenges. Small File Size: The total size of the game is less than 500 MB. It may come as a surprise as it's not even in the GBs. This was achieved through an integrated approach that combines good asset management, compression, 3D modelling and lighting features without giving up on production quality. Game Modes: There are three game modes in Recourse: Puzzle, Payload and Wave Rush which share elements but have different objectives. Each level contains a certain number of golden question marks that can be collected to ultimately unlock a mysterious weapon called ‘WINTER’. Puzzle Mode: The goal is to solve enough puzzles to reach the final checkpoint. Finishing puzzle levels unlock other game modes and levels. Puzzle levels are very peaceful: there are either very few or no Failbots that would disturb you. Payload Mode: Battle your way through armies of Failbots to collect their CPUs and deposit them to your wagon which must then be escorted to the finish line to complete the level. Deposited CPUs can be spent toward upgrading Floe. Wave Rush Mode: Failbots grow tougher with each wave. You can stay as long as you want or solve your way to the final checkpoint and complete the level when ready. Deployables: There are eight deployables that can be deployed to interact with the environment, solve puzzles and counter enemies. Each deployable applies damage in their own way. Circular Saw: Destroys crates (and more) blocking your way. Can be used to box in and damage Failbots. Incinerator: Burns enemies and affects heat-activated objects. Tesla Coil: A ranged tool that damages enemies with electric arcs. It also powers up sockets. Laser: Rotating lasers that damage characters and activate optical receivers. Vortex: Elevates and hurls enemies around. Powers wind-activated objects. Thumper: Screws itself to the floor and launches characters and physics objects in the air. Highly effective in launching enemies toward ceiling hazards or simply cause them falling damage. They can also break apart glaciers blocking your way. Point A: Teleports physics objects and characters to an activated Point B. Singularity: Pulls and traps enemies at its center. Can be used to turn slippery enemies into easy targets or pin them against environmental hazards. *",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/header.jpg?t=1649019973,http://recourse.cloudsandblue.com/,,support@cloudsandblue.com,True,False,False,0,,0,15,0,,53,0,,0,0,0,0,Clouds and Blue,Clouds and Blue,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Remote Play Together","Adventure,Casual,Indie","Puzzle-Platformer,Puzzle,Indie,Adventure,Casual,Local Co-Op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_6c7adb7c7f3f0befbe16f98488a502f691e8a117.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_d96c77d128a1d20eada1e6fa1dbe8a45f667b1c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_ced609e3aa19e08d11bbb9e28dddcff364680a48.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_57398089b2c625734dfc4d46ff6910b05a3010ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_61460e1d89313a1d42ce7b18b54a4d70cbf035bc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_2f3fbdaae8a356ac7ac6c79ccc6d35621fc0603d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_a7c64a7c99c91dd2c46e9fc9f146d4ae69386501.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_c6b3670359602285e89d47c94df345ee2b7065db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_534c25ba21d544bb9c88322d8cc59a2bff465584.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_b1aae428ee8813629dfe962071eb69fed4bb7eb8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_16af877f4e1515259dbe875269f37ae8ee149e1e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_2e67e89b0ea951da375d5a927455350740002d33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_88682f4cfbb0c81235a1bc0eacc4a411aaa55352.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_36c60a2434924ff77f0f3a72caed3f3853437f8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_4da20ffe7a1e10e6dad131ca75fb1398d22669ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_819a385feb2e2263a4a0a3564b4b3ca229a21e22.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413540/ss_4677a0f0db0b185cd125881c72e76e06b4b2cd88.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649019973",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256736666/movie_max.mp4?t=1544393623

1349830,RONIN: Two Souls CHAPTER 1,"May 27, 2021",50000 - 100000,0,0,14.99,0,"In this fictional world, witness the journey of Kenji, who lives on a small island in a deserted corner of Japan, meet other people and lead the story of Kenji. Kenji, who lives alone on the island of Toshi, one day had to do something he did not want, and his whole life changed. As a player, you are free to designate your enemies as friends and your friends as enemies. In our game with FPP and TPP camera angle, you can chat with people around and learn additional information about their lives. You can make friends with your enemies and benefit yourself from these friendships in the following episodes. Build the basic structure of your character in our first episode that we release as early access, build the game on this structure in new episodes added with updates. Give life to Kenji, who takes firm steps towards becoming a samurai. “Sometimes life becomes cruel and asks you to do something you don't want to do. You have to do it. Because you have no right to choose.” RONIN is a RPG that focuses on the story and completely frees the player into the game’s universe. It is an action/adventure game with its own style, where there are no boring and unnecessary missions which you play on and on to win the same loots. The Kenji character which we started the game with in Episode 1 works hard to become a samurai. But with the end of the first episode trouble comes after us that we can never escape. Kenji is no longer alone, and he can’t be alone until the mission is over. With the following episodes, privacy and many more mechanics will be added to the game. We even have crazy ideas like adding Co-op and PVP modes . We think you should know that we have high hopes for the Co-op mode. 2-PART ROAD MAP We believe that it’ll be better for us and for you to release the game in episodes. While the story will move one step further with the each episode, with the new features and localizations, we will gain more and more players and show you what we can do. Now I want all of you to be realistic, we are a small team living in Turkey and this project is a pretty big deal to us. If we want everything to be perfect, we have to be organized and move in small steps. Am I right? But we believe that this project will grow with you and turn into reality.","['English', 'Turkish', 'Simplified Chinese', 'German']","['English', 'Turkish', 'German']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/header.jpg?t=1652813492,https://m11studiogames.com,,,True,False,False,0,,0,222,33,,13,212,,0,0,0,0,M11 Studio,M11 Studio,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Commentary available,Remote Play Together","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG","Open World,Atmospheric,RPG,Character Customization,Adventure,Choose Your Own Adventure,Nature,Action-Adventure,Stylized,Dynamic Narration,Singleplayer,Choices Matter,First-Person,Action RPG,Fighting,Action,Text-Based,FPS,Swordplay,Story Rich","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_fa6d4b5682509fbbaeeb748dc58b06c6b49cbea6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_cadfac6a577cc62f1578b17d2cc82ba2884f7837.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_1e9d36f484596e2f1ca229fe46c16d84be447196.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_02a0aea53a33ce537a3d5801f6eb54b3f4f21946.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_6a555c111dc959fd7879acde296e8dac799792e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_d5d2d6b2f540c123101dc38435223ba78b878ca2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_f65336a5a22a1bc0a120db769d7f354cd40491fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_9fab8ceab1e8eb08acae3962327f74c9578dfe77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_d359604a7e3b2d46390085acb29504bc4041f66a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_7d92a815682e1a4fb0af1593ff11c5a57472e47e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_a7f8758dcf3ad77a29da4dcfa62db41fadb9f7e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_416ef6c5ba55bae6f8e131405dae5026b1ab8970.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1349830/ss_334729889d4946b1612d40638a5c5ed5189ce495.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652813492","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256830853/movie_max.mp4?t=1618605082,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256822479/movie_max.mp4?t=1618602644,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256822621/movie_max.mp4?t=1618602637"

A game in two parts: First, brave your way through a confusing maze of menus, then take to the air as the indefatigable 'Hoodie Girl' and blast sentient advertisements into cold, hard cash! FEATURES: Loop-tastic speed insanity! Every time you beat a level, the game speed increases! Time Pulse gameplay -- Slow down time and turn enemy bullets into score drops! 2-Player local co-op Weekly Leaderboard! Show up often + Show Off your play skills! Brand new Steam Achievements! PARKOUR!!! Based on a true story*! *Plus slight embellishments ==== WAIT, WHAT IS THIS? ==== Okay, so the actual shoot-em up plays like this: It's an infinitely looping, high score game. This is not a regular shooter, the level structure is not like R-Type or Ikaruga or Dodonpachi or most shmups. There is only *one level*, but it keeps changing with each loop. The crazy part is, every time you beat the level, the *speed of the game* increases. It gets quite challenging by loop 5, and incredibly difficulty by loop 8. To help out, there's a powerup called 'Time Pulse', in limited quantity. It slows down time temporarily, and if you shoot the enemy bullets during this time, you zap them into cash. And for every so-many bullets you destroy like this, you get a new Time Pulse! It's good to get you out of a jam, and man does it get tough later on. Once you understand the flow of the loops, you'll know when the best time to spend your Time Pulse, and you'll start to figure out how to chain them, earn more, to get further. -PARKOUR!",['English'],[],"“Game Type seems like the most constructive and creative response, providing an entry that exemplifies the current system’s problems while also contributing something worthwhile to the community and opens things up for discussion.” Thuderbolt “The in-your-face tale of Hoodie Girl’s SHMUP themed quest is one you can’t miss.” Horrible Night “Game Type is an important title...” Just Press Start",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/373630/header.jpg?t=1572555278,http://www.mommysbestgames.com/gametype.html,http://www.mommysbestgames.com,contact@mommysbestgames.com,True,False,False,0,,0,32,9,,12,0,,218,0,218,0,Mommy's Best Games,Mommy's Best Games,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play Together","Action,Indie","Action,Indie,Shoot 'Em Up,2D,Shooter,Local Co-Op,Comedy,Retro,Female Protagonist","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/373630/ss_a8a28eda66be1191f00867ec2aaca14111b7f241.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572555278,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/373630/ss_a6b0e205a301ff55f9c87bdc66b2e59a7626bfd4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572555278,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/373630/ss_8aa58aedd27881c47e95f8fcf0a3794cc66123cd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572555278,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/373630/ss_1c36f61015bb00f1eb716539a26fa673e7a7dd82.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572555278,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/373630/ss_20966ec4e5952f424819dac6a925b3ab9c1731ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572555278,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/373630/ss_5b69576c653d52302d8a88553b3dcb81287a12b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572555278,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/373630/ss_e03330418f582a3a3247427b14c2ca08ef7bfc56.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572555278,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/373630/ss_f5747666d63bbf79ee8b1ae0e23552278446f4ab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572555278",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256656266/movie_max.mp4?t=1447377990
